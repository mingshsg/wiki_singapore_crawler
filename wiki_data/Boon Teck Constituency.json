In 1988, following the establishment of [Group representation constituency](/wiki/Group_representation_constituency) (GRC) and SMC, it was merged into [Toa Payoh GRC](/wiki/Toa_Payoh_Group_Representation_Constituency). ## History In 1972, [Phey Yew Kok](/wiki/Phey_Yew_Kok) entered politics during the [1972 general election](/wiki/1972_Singaporean_general_election) under the PAP banner for Boon Teck constituency, and won 66.8% of the vote. He attributed his win by saying that many in the constituency were members of Singapore Industrial Labour Organisation (SILO) and Pioneer Industries Employees' Union of which he was the secretary general. Phey was reelected in the same constituency in the [1976 general election](/wiki/1976_Singaporean_general_election), winning 71.9% of the vote. From 1978 to 1979, Phey used $11,235 of SILO's funds to finance the purchase of shares of a supermarket and $6,510 of PIEU's funds to purchase shares of another supermarket. Neither purchase was done accordingly to the amendment to the Trade Unions Act in 1977 and with the legally required ministerial approval. In mid-1979, the [Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau](/wiki/Corrupt_Practices_Investigation_Bureau) (CPIB) launched an investigation into Phey over alleged malpractices in SILO and PIEU. Phey was formally charged on 10 December on two counts of the laws introduced in the 1977 amendments, over the abovementioned share purchases, and on four additional counts of criminal breach of trust. He pleaded not guilty and was placed under a $100,000 bail, pending a court hearing on 7 January 1980. Phey applied for a leave of absence from the [Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore) and it was granted on 4 January 1980. The leave was revoked on 26 February 1980 as its purpose, for Phey to deal with his court cases, was no longer valid with his escape from Singapore. His seat for the constituency was vacated on the deadline of 31 March 1980 set by the Speaker, after he failed to turn up for Parliament. Despite calls for a by-election, the seat remained vacant until the [general election](/wiki/1980_Singaporean_general_election) at the end of the year. ## Member of Parliament **Year** **Member****Party****Formation**(/wiki/1972_Singaporean_general_election)[Phey Yew Kok](/wiki/Phey_Yew_Kok)[PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)(/wiki/1976_Singaporean_general_election)(/wiki/1980_Singaporean_general_election)Liew Kok Phun[PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)(/wiki/1984_Singaporean_general_election)Ho Tat Kin[PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)**Constituency abolished (1988)** ## Electoral results Note: The [Elections Department](/wiki/Elections_Department_Singapore) does not include rejected votes when calculating the vote shares of candidates.
