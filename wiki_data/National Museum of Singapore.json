Located within the country's [Civic District](/wiki/Civic_District) at the [Downtown Core](/wiki/Downtown_Core) area, it is the oldest museum in the country, with its history dating back to when it was first established in 1849, starting out as a section of a library at the [Singapore Institution](/wiki/Singapore_Institution)[d] as the **Raffles Library and Museum**. After several relocations over the next few decades, the museum moved to its current permanent site at [Stamford Road](/wiki/Stamford_Road) in 1887. Between 1993 and March 2006, it was briefly known as the **Singapore History Museum**, before it subsequently returned to its present name that was first given in 1965. The museum preserves and interprets Singapore's social history, exploring the key events and people that have shaped the nation. Over the years, the National Museum of Singapore has expanded and undergone various expansions and renovations. Its most recent restoration and upgrading works began in September 2023 with staggered gallery closures, and is slated for a full reopening in October 2026. The museum remains open in the meantime with exhibitions and programmes. The previous three-and-a-half-year restoration was completed on 2 December 2006, and was officially reopened on 7 December 2006 by former [President of Singapore](/wiki/President_of_Singapore) [S. R. Nathan](/wiki/S._R._Nathan) and the [Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts](/wiki/Ministry_of_Communications_and_Information) [Lee Boon Yang](/wiki/Lee_Boon_Yang). The Singapore History Gallery would open on 8 December that same year. It is one of six national museums in the country; the other five being the two [Asian Civilisations Museums](/wiki/Asian_Civilisations_Museum) at [Empress Place Building](/wiki/Empress_Place_Building) and [Old Tao Nan School](/wiki/Old_Tao_Nan_School) respectively, the [Singapore Art Museum](/wiki/Singapore_Art_Museum), [Peranakan Museum](/wiki/Peranakan_Museum) as well as the [National Gallery Singapore](/wiki/National_Gallery_Singapore).

It is one of the largest museums in Asia. The National Museum of Singapore exhibits sculptures, [objets d'art](/wiki/Objet_d%27art), paintings, drawings, and archaeological finds. Admission to the National Museum of Singapore is complimentary for Singaporean citizens and permanent residents. ## History The museum was established in 1849 by the then Singapore Institution Committee, and is the oldest museum in Singapore, hence its 19th century exterior design. Upon establishment, it was known as the **Raffles Library and Museum**, starting out as a section of a library at the [Singapore Institution](/wiki/Singapore_Institution)[e] before moving to 93 Stamford Road in 1887 after several relocations, where it is currently located. Between 1993 and March 2006, it was known as the **Singapore History Museum**, before it subsequently returned to its present name that was first given in 1965 as the National Museum of Singapore. Over the centuries, the National Museum of Singapore has expanded and undergone various expansions and renovations, with a three-and-a-half-year restoration that was completed on 2 December 2006, and was officially reopened on 7 December 2006 by [President of Singapore](/wiki/President_of_Singapore) [S. R. Nathan](/wiki/S._R._Nathan) and the [Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts](/wiki/Ministry_of_Communications_and_Information) [Lee Boon Yang](/wiki/Lee_Boon_Yang). The museum was designated a [National Monument of Singapore](/wiki/National_monuments_of_Singapore) on 14 February 1992 by the [National Heritage Board](/wiki/National_Heritage_Board_(Singapore)). ## Collection This section **needs expansion**.
