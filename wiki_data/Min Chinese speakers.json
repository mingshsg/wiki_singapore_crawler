They mainly live or trace roots from [Fujian](/wiki/Fujian), [Hainan](/wiki/Hainan), Southern [Zhejiang](/wiki/Zhejiang) and [Guangdong province](/wiki/Guangdong)'s [Leizhou](/wiki/Leizhou) and [Chaoshan](/wiki/Chaoshan) regions. The Min Chinese are a strongly diasporic community, with emphasis on entrepreneurship through communal *[guanxi](/wiki/Guanxi)*-based networks. Today, they play a significant role in the economies of Greater China and Southeast Asia, and are heavily represented in business and commercial sectors. In the [Chinese diaspora](/wiki/Overseas_Chinese), they form the majority of people in [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan) and the majority of Han Chinese in [Southeast Asian](/wiki/Southeast_Asian) countries, like [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand), [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia), [Myanmar](/wiki/Myanmar), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), and the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines). The first two countries have majority [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect)-speaking Chinese minorities, whereas the last four house [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien)-speaking Chinese minorities. Min-speaking enclaves are also significant among Chinese communities in [the United States](/wiki/United_States), [the United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom), [Canada](/wiki/Canada) and [Australia](/wiki/Australia). In recent decades, Min-speaking Chinese have established communities across [Asia](/wiki/Asia), [Europe](/wiki/Europe), [Africa](/wiki/Africa) and [South America](/wiki/South_America). ## Subgroups ### China #### Fujian - [Fuzhou people](/wiki/Fuzhou_people) 福州人 ([Eastern Min](/wiki/Eastern_Min)) - [Minbei people](/wiki/Northern_Min) 閩北人 ([Northern Min](/wiki/Northern_Min), [Central Min](/wiki/Central_Min) and [Shao-Jiang Min](/wiki/Shao-Jiang_Min)) - [Putian people](/wiki/Putian_people) 莆田人 ([Pu-Xian Min](/wiki/Pu-Xian_Min)) - [Hokkien people](/wiki/Hokkien_people) 閩南人 ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) #### Guangdong - [Teochew people](/wiki/Teochew_people) 潮州人 ([Teo-Swa](/wiki/Chaoshan_Min) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) - [Hailufeng people](/wiki/Haklau_Min) 海陸豐人 ([Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) - [Leizhou people](/wiki/Leizhou_Min) 雷州人 (Qiong–Lei Min) - [Zhongshan people](/wiki/Zhongshan_Min) 中山閩人 (Zhongshan Min) #### Zhejiang - [Zhenan people](/wiki/Zhenan_Min) 浙南閩人 ([Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) #### Hainan - [Hainanese people](/wiki/Hainan_people) 海南人 (Qiong–Lei Min) ### Japan - [Thirty-six families from Min](/wiki/Thirty-six_families_from_Min) ### Taiwan - [Hoklo Taiwanese](/wiki/Hoklo_Taiwanese) ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) ### Philippines - [Hokkien](/wiki/Philippine_Hokkien) [Chinese Filipinos](/wiki/Chinese_Filipino) ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) ### Brunei - [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Chinese Bruneians](/wiki/Chinese_Bruneian) ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) ### Malaysia - [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Malaysian Chinese](/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese) ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) - [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect) [Malaysian Chinese](/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese) ([Teo-Swa](/wiki/Chaoshan_Min) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) - [Hainanese](/wiki/Hainanese) [Malaysian Chinese](/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese) (Qiong–Lei Min) - [Foochow](/wiki/Eastern_Min) [Malaysian Chinese](/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese) ([Eastern Min](/wiki/Eastern_Min)) - [Hockchia](/wiki/Fuqing_dialect) [Malaysian Chinese](/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese) ([Eastern Min](/wiki/Eastern_Min)) ### Singapore - [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Chinese Singaporeans](/wiki/Chinese_Singaporean) ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) - [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect) [Chinese Singaporeans](/wiki/Chinese_Singaporean) ([Teo-Swa](/wiki/Chaoshan_Min) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) - [Hainanese](/wiki/Hainanese) [Chinese Singaporeans](/wiki/Chinese_Singaporean) (Qiong–Lei Min) - [Henghua](/wiki/Putian_dialect) [Chinese Singaporeans](/wiki/Chinese_Singaporean) ([Pu-Xian Min](/wiki/Pu-Xian_Min)) ### Indonesia - [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Chinese Indonesians](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian) ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) - [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect) [Chinese Indonesians](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian) ([Teo-Swa](/wiki/Chaoshan_Min) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) - [Hainanese](/wiki/Hainanese) [Chinese Indonesians](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian) (Qiong–Lei Min) - [Luichew](/wiki/Leizhou_Min) [Chinese Indonesians](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian) (Qiong–Lei Min) - [Hinghwa](/wiki/Putian_dialect) [Chinese Indonesians](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian) ([Pu-Xian Min](/wiki/Pu-Xian_Min)) - [Hokcia](/wiki/Fuqing_dialect) [Chinese Indonesians](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian) ([Eastern Min](/wiki/Eastern_Min)) ### Myanmar - [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Chinese Burmese](/wiki/Chinese_Burmese) ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) ### Thailand - [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect) [Thai Chinese](/wiki/Thai_Chinese) ([Teo-Swa](/wiki/Chaoshan_Min) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) - [Hainanese](/wiki/Hainanese) [Thai Chinese](/wiki/Thai_Chinese) (Qiong–Lei Min) - [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Thai Chinese](/wiki/Thai_Chinese) ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) ### Cambodia - [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect) [Chinese Cambodians](/wiki/Chinese_Cambodian) ([Teo-Swa](/wiki/Chaoshan_Min) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) - [Hainanese](/wiki/Hainanese) [Chinese Cambodians](/wiki/Chinese_Cambodian) (Qiong–Lei Min) - [Hokkien](/wiki/Cambodian_Hokkien) [Chinese Cambodians](/wiki/Chinese_Cambodian) ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) ### Vietnam - [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect) [Hoa people](/wiki/Hoa_people) ([Teo-Swa](/wiki/Chaoshan_Min) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) - [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Hoa people](/wiki/Hoa_people) ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) - [Hainanese](/wiki/Hainanese) [Hoa people](/wiki/Hoa_people) (Qiong–Lei Min) ### Madagascar - [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Sinoa](/wiki/Chinese_people_in_Madagascar) ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min)) ## Culture ### Trade and Industry Migratory trading lies at the crux of Min Chinese society. Traditionally, Confucian culture looked down upon commerce, placing it at the bottom of the [Four Occupations](/wiki/Four_Occupations). Nevertheless, the infertile, mountainous landscape of Fujian and surrounding areas, coupled by easy access to the open ocean, compelled many Min-speaking Chinese to seek survival based off trade. By contrast to other groups, notably the [Shanxi merchants](/wiki/Shanxi_merchants), where mercantilism was rooted in a select merchant class closely tied to the Imperial Government, the merchants of Fujian were for most of their history peripheral to the centres of power. This allowed Min-speaking Chinese to carve out a cultural niche in entrepreneurship, risk-taking and diasporic migration that would pass down and sustain among the community throughout generations. By the time of the Ming Dynasty, Min-speaking communities became increasingly valued by the government as shipbuilders, navigators, and maritime merchants, and often utilised as envoys to Southeast Asia and Japan for trading and diplomacy purposes. For example, the [Thirty-six families from Min](/wiki/Thirty-six_families_from_Min) were influential in the development of Confucian culture in the [Ryukyu Islands](/wiki/Ryukyu_Islands). Today, the influence of entrepreneurship on Min Chinese culture is remarkable. From the towering tycoons of Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok to humble shopkeepers that range through areas as diverse as New York and Algiers, the contribution of Min-speaking Chinese to the modern economy is momentous. Although Min-speaking Chinese groups make up only 2% of the total Chinese population, they have contributed to the economic scene of Greater China far more significantly than their numbers may suggest. During the colonial era, the [Canton System](/wiki/Canton_System) of trade was heavily monopolized by merchants of Min Chinese ancestry, with [Puankhequa](/wiki/Puankhequa) and [Howqua](/wiki/Howqua), both of Southern Min descent, becoming some of the wealthiest men in China in their time. These Min-speaking merchants would become inseparable to the economic fabric of Canton, even as they assimilated themselves into the [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese) majority. Min communities have also tapped heavily into real estate markets across China, owning as much as 60 percent of properties across various second- and third-tier cities in inland China and contributing to the vitality and prosperity of local townships. Recently, Chinese of Min origin have gained considerable presence in technological sectors, as represented by tycoons such as [Ma Huateng](/wiki/Ma_Huateng), [Zhang Yiming](/wiki/Zhang_Yiming) and [Wang Xing](/wiki/Wang_Xing). Remittances from the overseas Min diaspora have also contributed to the political scene in China, funding [Sun Yat-sen's](/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen) [Tongmenghui](/wiki/Tongmenghui) and the [1911 Xinhai Revolution](/wiki/1911_Revolution), and were also important to boosting the economy of China as a whole and Fujian province on an individual scale. While the economic dominance and occasional business practices of Min Chinese entrepreneurs have generated some controversy, the community is by and large respected as an integral part of the Chinese economic framework. Besides China, Min-speaking communities also hold substantial economic clout over the countries of Southeast Asia. Since the Ming Dynasty, Chinese merchants from Fujian and surrounding areas have created an elaborate, relational-based network across the South China Sea that would pave the wave for future Chinese economic dominance over the region, particularly following waves of *xiananyang* (lit. \"down the South Seas\") migration sparked by conflict and poverty in China. Today, the Chinese, particularly those of Min descent, would dominate commerce at every level of southeast Asian society. Unlike in China, where shared culture between the Min and local populations allowed for easier assimilation into their host communities, in Southeast Asia, Min-speaking migrants often maintained a degree of cultural distinction, creating tight-knit, self-sustaining enclaves that preserved their dialects, customs, and commercial practices. Their success hinged on a delicate balance, to forge strong economic and personal networks with indigenous populations while simultaneously retaining enough internal cohesion to protect their interests across generations. Over time, these communities expanded their influence beyond small trading posts into major urban centers, establishing powerful business conglomerates that would dominate sectors ranging from retail and shipping to banking and real estate. The legacy of this commercial dominance remains visible today, with many of Southeast Asia's largest family-run enterprises and wealthiest tycoons tracing their roots back to these early Min-speaking settlers. Beyond China and Southeast Asia, Min-speaking Chinese communities have established significant diasporas across the Western world, including North America, Europe, and Oceania. In the United States, Min-speaking immigrants have formed enclaves in [Chinatowns](/wiki/Chinatown), such as [Little Fuzhou](/wiki/Little_Fuzhou) in New York. These communities often revolve around family associations and regional networks, facilitating mutual support and business opportunities. Despite facing challenges such as language barriers and legal hurdles, many have found success in sectors like hospitality, construction, and retail. In recent decades, the Fujianese diaspora has played a pivotal role in China's economic engagement with Africa. While still dominated by large-scale, state-led infrastructure projects, the backbone of Chinese investment comes from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), primarily driven by Min-speaking entrepreneurs who leverage tight-nit, clan-based networks to fill niches overlooked by larger corporations. - [Chinese people](/wiki/Chinese_people) - [Han Chinese](/wiki/Han_Chinese) - [Min Chinese](/wiki/Min_Chinese)\n",
