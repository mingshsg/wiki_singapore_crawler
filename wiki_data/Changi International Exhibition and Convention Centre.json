It currently offers over 23,000 square metres (250,000 sq ft) of space, as well as 14,000 square metres (150,000 sq ft) of outdoor space for exhibitions and functions. The [Singapore Airshow](/wiki/Singapore_Airshow) is now held at a new purpose-built centre, the [Changi Exhibition Centre](/wiki/Changi_Exhibition_Centre). The status of the current facility is still pending as there are considerations for Singapore Changi Airport to expand and subsume the site into a new facility or other purposes related to it.
