  "content": "Historic building in Singapore The **Vanguard Building**, formerly known as the **Malaysia Publishing House Building**, or simply the **MPH Building**, is a historic building on the corner of [Armenian Street](/wiki/Armenian_Street,_Singapore) and [Stamford Road](/wiki/Stamford_Road). It initially housed the [Methodist Publishing House](/wiki/MPH_Group). Since 2014, it has been leased to the [Singapore Management University](/wiki/Singapore_Management_University). ## Description The building is one of the few remaining examples of [Edwardian architecture](/wiki/Edwardian_architecture) in Singapore. It features pedimented and arched windows and [rusticated](/wiki/Rustication_(architecture)) [piers](/wiki/Pier_(architecture)). It also features Baroque arches, which are supported by a first-storey [arcade](/wiki/Arcade_(architecture)). ## History The building was built in 1908, housing the [Methodist Publishing House](/wiki/MPH_Group). It was designed by architectural firm [Swan & Maclaren](/wiki/Swan_%26_Maclaren_Architects). Following [WWII](/wiki/WWII), [Frank Cooper Sands](/wiki/Frank_Cooper_Sands), then Managing Director of MPH, restored and reopened the bookstore. In 1988, it was announced that the interior of the building would be redeveloped for $10 million. The building reopened in November 1991, with a new cafe and the third floor being dedicated to music. The Singapore branch of the [United States Information Service](/wiki/United_States_Information_Service) was relocated to the top floor of the newly redeveloped building. Vanguard Interiors bought the property for $25 million and leased it back to the MPH until 2003. In 2003, the building was gazetted for conservation by the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority). It was then leased to AIT Unicampus. In October 2006, Vanguard Interiors moved its offices and its showroom into the building. The [Singapore Management University](/wiki/Singapore_Management_University) signed a five-year lease for the building in 2014 and renamed it SMU Labs. 1°17′41″N 103°50′59″E﻿ / ﻿1.2947°N 103.8498°E﻿ / 1.2947; 103.8498\n",
