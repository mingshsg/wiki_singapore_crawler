The cake is typically baked during festive occasions and holidays like Christmas, by members of [Malaccan Portuguese](/wiki/Kristang_people) in [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca) and the larger Eurasian community in [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). The word *sugee* has its origins in [Hindustani](/wiki/Hindustani_language) word for 'semolina' (सूजी). Sugee cake is similar to the Sri Lankan [Love cake](/wiki/Love_cake) baked during Christmas by the Eurasian [Burgher people](/wiki/Burgher_people), which uses cashew as opposed to almonds. In 2020, [Shake Shack](/wiki/Shake_Shack) adapted the flavor of the sugee cake in a limited edition milkshake, dubbed \"sugee boogie.\" - [Kristang people](/wiki/Kristang_people) - [Eurasians in Singapore](/wiki/Eurasians_in_Singapore) This [Malaysian cuisine](/wiki/Malaysian_cuisine)-related article is a stub.
