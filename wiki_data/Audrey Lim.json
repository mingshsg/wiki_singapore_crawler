  "content": "High Court Judge of the Singapore Supreme Court Justice **Audrey Lim Yoon Cheng** is a [High Court Judge](/wiki/High_Court_Judge) of the [Singapore Supreme Court](/wiki/Singapore_Supreme_Court). She was appointed as Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court in 2016 and as a [High Court](/wiki/High_Court_of_Singapore) Judge in 2019. She graduated from the [University of Cambridge](/wiki/University_of_Cambridge) in 1993. Lim was the trial judge who sentenced [Leslie Khoo Kwee Hock](/wiki/Leslie_Khoo_Kwee_Hock) to [life imprisonment](/wiki/Life_imprisonment) after convicting of [murder](/wiki/Murder) for the death of his girlfriend Cui Yajie at [Gardens by the Bay](/wiki/Gardens_by_the_Bay). She agreed with the prosecutor [Hri Kumar Nair](/wiki/Hri_Kumar_Nair)'s arguments for life imprisonment as Khoo did not exhibit any blatant disregard for human life or viciousness from the manner of killing, for which his case would not warrant the [death penalty](/wiki/Death_penalty) (the maximum punishment for murder) in comparison to precedent legal cases.
