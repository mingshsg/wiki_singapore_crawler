The channel was owned by [Paramount Networks EMEAA](/wiki/Paramount_Networks_EMEAA). ## History ### Pre-launch The first incarnation of MTV Asia was launched on 15 September 1991 as part of a joint venture between the [STAR TV Network](/wiki/Disney_Networks_Group_Asia_Pacific) and [Viacom](/wiki/Viacom_(1952%E2%80%932005)). On 2 May 1994, MTV Asia ended its partnership with STAR TV, and the channel space was subsequently taken over by [Channel V](/wiki/Channel_V) on 27 May 1994. ### Launch MTV Southeast Asia was officially launched on 5 May 1995 at 8:00 p.m. Singapore Time (SGT) as a [24-hour](/wiki/24-hour_clock) [English-language](/wiki/Singapore_English) [music channel](/wiki/Music_video), broadcasting from [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) and available across [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia), including territories such as [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). Simultaneously, MTV Southeast Asia and its sister channel [MTV Indonesia](/wiki/MTV_Indonesia) were launched via the [Palapa C2](/wiki/Palapa) [digital satellite](/wiki/Communications_satellite). The channel was originally scheduled to launch in the last quarter of 1994. Headquartered at [Shenton Way](/wiki/Shenton_Way), the channel operated as a joint venture with [Polygram](/wiki/Polygram). At the time of its launch, MTV Southeast Asia had secured 31 advertisers, while its Mandarin-language counterpart had 16, generating revenues described as being in the \"hundreds of thousands\". By 1997, the channel had a team of 30 [video jockeys](/wiki/Video_jockey) (VJs), with plans to expand the roster further. From 1 May 2021 to 1 September 2022, MTV Southeast Asia reduced its original programming to an 8-hour block, airing from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight ([SGT](/wiki/Singapore_Time)). During the remaining hours, from 12:00 midnight to 4:00 p.m. ([SGT](/wiki/Singapore_Time)), the channel simulcast content from its sister network, [MTV Live](/wiki/MTV_Live_(international_TV_channel)). This change reflected a shift in programming strategy to focus more on music content and reduce entertainment programming. ### Closure As part of a restructuring by Paramount Networks EMEAA, MTV Asia began ceasing operations in several territories. In Singapore, the channel was discontinued on [StarHub TV](/wiki/StarHub_TV) on 29 April 2022, following StarHub's review of its content offerings and the launch of MTV Asia On Demand. MTV Asia officially ceased broadcasting after 27 years. It was replaced by [MTV Live](/wiki/MTV_Live_(international_TV_channel)) on platforms such as [Astro](/wiki/Astro_(company)), [Unifi TV](/wiki/Unifi_TV), and [I-Cable](/wiki/I-Cable_Communications), while other providers began carrying [MTV 90s](/wiki/MTV_90s). However, its digital platforms have remained operational through its official [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube) channel and various social media accounts. ## VJs ## Final programming ### Music video blocks - *Global Beats* - *Hot Right Now* - *High Definition Hits* - *K-Wave* - *MTV Musika* - *MTV Rewind* - *Rock Solid Playlist* ### Concert/Live performances - *[MTV Unplugged](/wiki/MTV_Unplugged)* - *MTV World Stage* ## Former programs - [List of programmes broadcast by MTV in Asia](/wiki/List_of_programmes_broadcast_by_MTV_in_Asia) - [MTV](/wiki/MTV) - [MTV Mandarin](/wiki/MTV_Mandarin) (1995–2003, defunct/split) - MTV Taiwan (2003–, ongoing, based in [Taipei](/wiki/Taipei), co-owned and operated by [Sanlih E-Television](/wiki/Sanlih_E-Television) since early 2010s.) - MTV China (2003–2021, defunct) - [MTV India](/wiki/MTV_India) (1996–ongoing) - [MTV Korea](/wiki/MTV_Korea) (2001–2022, defunct) - [MTV Pakistan](/wiki/MTV_Pakistan) (2006–2011, defunct) - [MTV Vietnam](/wiki/MTV_(Vietnamese_TV_channel)) (2011–2023, defunct) - [MTV Thailand](/wiki/MTV_Thailand) (2001–2011, 2013–2016, defunct) - [MTV Philippines](/wiki/MTV_(Philippines,_1992%E2%80%932010)) (1992–2010, defunct) - [Studio 23](/wiki/Studio_23) (1996–1999) - [IBC 13](/wiki/Intercontinental_Broadcasting_Corporation) (2005) - [MTV Pinoy](/wiki/MTV_Pinoy) (2014–2016, 2017, defunct) - [MTV Indonesia](/wiki/MTV_Indonesia) (1995–2012, 2014–2015, defunct) - [ANteve](/wiki/Antv) (1995–2002) - [Global TV](/wiki/GTV_(Indonesian_TV_network)) (2002–2012) - CTV Banten (2014–2015) - [RTV](/wiki/RTV_(Indonesia)) (2015) - [MTVph](/wiki/MTVph) (2017–2018, defunct) - [Paramount International Networks](/wiki/Paramount_International_Networks) (formerly MTV Networks Asia Pacific)\n",
