Worshipping the Empress Registrar of Birth or [Doumu](/wiki/Doumu) (斗母) and [Nine Emperor Gods](/wiki/Nine_Emperor_Gods_Festival) (九皇大帝), the temple has both Taoist and [Buddhist](/wiki/Buddhism) influences. There are other temples dedicated to Tou Mu (Dou Mu) in many parts of [China](/wiki/China) (e.g. on [Mount Tai](/wiki/Mount_Tai)). ## History The temple started as a home shrine by Ong Choo Kee, a Chinese merchant. Ong had vowed to [venerate](/wiki/Veneration) the Nine Emperor Gods in exchange for successful business deals. He became successful and his home shrine became popular with an increase of worshippers. A Hokkien pineapple tycoon, Ong Chwee Tow (王水斗), donated a land parcel in [Hougang](/wiki/Hougang) to build a proper temple for worshippers. The temple started construction in 1919 and completed in 1921. It caters to the [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_people) community, and was one of two remaining temples in Singapore with a permanent [Chinese opera](/wiki/Chinese_opera) stage until 1998. For eight decades, Chinese opera was performed there during religious and other festivals. The temple was [gazetted](/wiki/Gazetted) as a [national monument](/wiki/National_Monuments_of_Singapore), which was deemed to be of special historic and traditional value, on 14 January 2005. ## Architecture The temple has a symmetrical floor plan with a central air-well. Behind the main hall is a two-story [pagoda](/wiki/Pagoda). Single-storey quarters for the keepers of the temple are located at the rear of the temple. The roof of the temple is decorated with dancing [dragons](/wiki/Dragon). There is also a ridge decoration in the main temple hall. The centre of the ridge has a blazing [pearl](/wiki/Pearl). Dragons and [dragon fish](/wiki/Arowana) are used to terminate the ridges. [Hips](/wiki/Hip_(roofing)) are terminated by spirals. The roof [trusses](/wiki/Truss) are typically [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_architecture), decorated with [carvings](/wiki/Stone_carving) and simple [brackets](/wiki/Bracket_(architecture)). The main doors are painted with pictures of the [Door Gods](/wiki/Door_God). Its colour scheme of light blue and brown is rather subdued when compared to other temples. The main [altar](/wiki/Altar) is dedicated to the main deity (Nine Emperor). To the left of the main altar is an altar to *[Dou Mu](/wiki/Doumu)* (Tou Mu), and to the right, [Guan Yin](/wiki/Kuan_Yin). An [inscription](/wiki/Inscription) on a wall [plaque](/wiki/Memorial_Plaque) above the main entrance shows the names of benefactors and the date of construction of the temple. ## Sources - \"NTU team to study popular Taoist festival of the Nine Emperor Gods\".
