The word Taman is [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) for [garden](/wiki/Garden) or [park](/wiki/Park); which literally translates to \"Jurong Garden/Park\". ## History Developed in 1963, Taman Jurong is one of the oldest residential precincts in Singapore, built by [JTC Corporation (JTC)](/wiki/JTC_Corporation) to house the workforce of the Jurong Industrial Estate. In its early years, Taman Jurong consisted of mostly one- and two-bedroom flats. Larger and high-rise flats were only constructed by JTC in the late 1960s when the town faced rapid growth. Taman Jurong was home to many of Singapore's pioneering amenities. It was home to the former Taman Jurong Camp, which housed Singapore's first batch of national servicemen in 1967. The former Jurong Drive-in Cinema, Singapore's first and only drive-in theatre, opened in 1971 along Yuan Ching Road, before its closure in 1985. In 1973, Jurong Stadium was built along Corporation Road, serving as Jurong's first sports venue. Unitl its demolition in 2020, it hosted several decentralised [National Day celebrations](/wiki/Singapore_National_Day_parade) in the 1970s and 1980s, and military ceremonies for the [Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces).
