Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *Find sources:* \"President's Scholar\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(February 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* A **President's Scholar** is a recipient of the academic scholarship awarded by the [Government of Singapore](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore) annually, to pursue undergraduate education at a university, usually abroad. The scholarship is considered to be the most prestigious public undergraduate scholarship in Singapore awarded to students of [Singaporean nationality](/wiki/Singaporean_nationality_law). All recipients have legal obligation to serve a bond—in the form of a public service career for a certain period of time, usually ranging from 4 to 6 years, after completing his or her studies in the university. Shortlisted candidates are interviewed by a selection committee chaired by the Chairman of the [Public Service Commission](/wiki/Public_Service_Commission_(Singapore)) (PSC) of Singapore. The President's Scholarship by itself does not award any money or lead to any particular career in public service. As such, it is generally paired with another scholarship, which could be either of the following: - [The SAF Scholarship](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_Overseas_Scholarship) - The [SPF](/wiki/Singapore_Police_Force) Scholarship - The [PSC](/wiki/Public_Service_Commission_(Singapore)) Scholarship ## History The President's Scholarship has its roots in the [Queen's Scholarship](/wiki/Queen%27s_Scholar_(British_Malaya_and_Singapore)), which was founded in 1885. The Queen's Scholarship was initiated by [Cecil Clementi Smith](/wiki/Cecil_Clementi_Smith), Governor of the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements). It was awarded to the best performing student of the year by a special selection board. The Queen's Scholarship was abolished in 1959 and replaced by the Singapore State Scholarship when Singapore gained self-governance. In August 1964, the [Yang di-Pertuan Negara](/wiki/Yang_di-Pertuan_Negara) Scholarship was inaugurated to replace the State Scholarship. In 1966, after Singapore achieved independence, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara Scholarship was renamed the President's Scholarship. ## Recipients Many recipients of the President's Scholarship went on to serve in top positions in the civil service. According to statistics collected by the newspaper *[The Straits Times](/wiki/The_Straits_Times)*, the schools in Singapore having the highest number of President's Scholars among their alumni are as follows:[*citation needed*] SchoolNumber of President's Scholars[Raffles Institution](/wiki/Raffles_Institution)96[Hwa Chong Institution](/wiki/Hwa_Chong_Institution)58[National Junior College](/wiki/National_Junior_College)45Notable recipients of the President's Scholarship NameYear receivedRemarksRefPolitics[Lim Boon Keng](/wiki/Lim_Boon_Keng)1887Member, British Legislative Council[Edmund W.
