Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *Find sources:* \"Mamak stall\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(January 2025)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* **Mamak stalls** are indoor and open-air food establishments found in [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia), especially in [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), that typically serve food derived from [Indian](/wiki/Indian_cuisine) Muslim, [Pakistani](/wiki/Pakistani_cuisine), and [Bangladeshi](/wiki/Bangladeshi_cuisine) cuisines, unique to the region. ## History Mamak stalls originate from [Tamil Muslims](/wiki/Tamil_Muslim), most of whom migrated from [South India](/wiki/South_India) and [Ceylon](/wiki/British_Ceylon) (modern-day [Sri Lanka](/wiki/Sri_Lanka)) to the [Malay Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula) and other locations in Southeast Asia centuries ago. They are regarded as part of the \"[Malaysian Indian](/wiki/Malaysian_Indian)/[Singaporean Indian](/wiki/Singaporean_Indian)\" community, or \"Straits Indian\". Archaeological findings in the [Bujang Valley](/wiki/Bujang_Valley) of Kedah suggest a trade relationship with India as early as the 1st to 5th century C.E. An inscription dated 779 AD that refers to the trade relationship between the [Tamilakam](/wiki/Tamilakam) and the region was found in [Nakhon Si Thammarat](/wiki/Nakhon_Si_Thammarat), Southern Thailand, dating to the [Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom](/wiki/Nakhon_Si_Thammarat_Kingdom). The word \"mamak\" is from the [Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_language) term for maternal uncle, or *maa-ma*. In Singapore and Malaysia, it is used by children as an [honorific](/wiki/Honorific) to respectfully address adults such as shopkeepers. Although the origins of the word are benign and neutral, it can sometimes be used as a derogatory term and insult against the [South Asian Muslim](/wiki/Islam_in_South_Asia) community in Malaysia and Singapore, and therefore its usage is generally avoided outside of specifically referring to mamak stalls. **Mamak stalls** and **Hindu stalls** are alike except that mamaks, who are Muslims, do not serve pork but do serve beef, whereas Hindus serve neither beef nor pork. There are also similar stalls run by local [Malays](/wiki/Malays_(ethnic_group)).[*citation needed*] ## Design Mamak stalls' affordable food and unpretentious atmosphere tend to create a casual dining atmosphere. Newer mamak stalls have more of a café aspect, usually being well lit and furnished with stainless steel tables. Some are outfitted with large flat screen televisions, or even projectors, so that patrons can catch the latest programs or live matches as they dine. Some mamak stalls also provide free [Wi-Fi](/wiki/Wi-Fi) service. Despite these innovations, many modern mamak stalls attempt to retain their predecessors' open air dining atmosphere by setting up tables on a patio, the [shoplot](/wiki/Shoplot)'s walkway, or even on the street.[*citation needed*] ## Fare This section **does not cite any sources**.
