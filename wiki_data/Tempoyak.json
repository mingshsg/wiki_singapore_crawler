  "content": "Malay condiment made from fermented durian **Tempoyak** ([Jawi](/wiki/Jawi_script): تمڤويق‎), **asam durian** or **pekasam** is a [Malay](/wiki/Malay_cuisine) [condiment](/wiki/Condiment) made from [fermented](/wiki/Fermentation_in_food_processing) [durian](/wiki/Durian). It is usually consumed by the [ethnic Malays](/wiki/Ethnic_Malays) in [Maritime Southeast Asia](/wiki/Maritime_Southeast_Asia), notably in [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia) and [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia). Tempoyak is made by crushing durian flesh and mixing it with some salt and kept in room temperature from three to seven days for fermentation. Tempoyaks are usually made during the durian season, when the abundance of durian and excess production are made into fermented tempoyak. Tempoyak is not normally consumed on its own; it is usually eaten as condiment or as an ingredient for cooking, such as when it is cooked with coconut milk curry as *[gulai](/wiki/Gulai) tempoyak ikan patin* ([pangasius](/wiki/Pangasius) fish tempoyak curry), or mixed with spicy chili pepper as *[sambal](/wiki/Sambal) tempoyak*. ## Fermentation In the [Malay Archipelago](/wiki/Malay_Archipelago), fermented durian is known by many names. It is commonly known as *tempoyak* in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and Southern Sumatra region (South Sumatra, Jambi, Bengkulu and Lampung provinces). It is known as *pekasam* in [Aceh](/wiki/Aceh) and *asam durian* in the Minangkabau region of [West Sumatra](/wiki/West_Sumatra). The word *asam* which translates to \"sour\" describes its [fermentation](/wiki/Fermentation) process. Tempoyak is made by crushing the flesh of durian and mixing it with salt or sugar. It is kept at room temperature (28–34 °C) and left to ferment for three to seven days, under [anaerobic conditions](/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental)) (obtained by closing the container lid). The bacteria involved in the fermentation process can vary depending on many factors such as durian variety, fermentation conditions and indigenous microorganisms in the environment. One study reported a progressive succession of different native [lactic acid bacteria](/wiki/Lactic_acid_bacteria) during the fermentation process, with Lactobacillus mesenteroides and Fructobacillus durionis being prominent in the early phases, with the latter remaining dominant throughout the fermentation. Another author found that predominant strains are: [Weissella paramesenteroides](/wiki/Weissella_paramesenteroides), [Enterococcus faecalis](/wiki/Enterococcus_faecalis), [Enterococcus gallinarum](/wiki/Enterococcus_gallinarum), [Lactobacillus plantarum](/wiki/Lactobacillus_plantarum), [Lactobacillus brevis](/wiki/Lactobacillus_brevis), [Lactobacillus fermentum](/wiki/Lactobacillus_fermentum), Lactobacillus mali, Lactobacillus mesenteroides, [Lactobacillus casei](/wiki/Lactobacillus_casei) and [Pediococcus acidilactici](/wiki/Pediococcus_acidilactici). These lactic acid bacteria inhibit the growth of harmful decomposing bacteria, such as *[Escherichia coli](/wiki/Escherichia_coli)*, which in turn preserves the durian flesh. Besides its functions as a food preservative, fermented tempoyak also serves as a natural food flavoring. The addition of tempoyak into chili paste and curry can add a distinct aroma and savoury flavour to the dish. ## History Just like many fermented food products in the region (e.g. *[belacan](/wiki/Shrimp_paste)*, *[pekasam](/wiki/Pekasam)*, *[cincalok](/wiki/Cincalok)*, *[budu](/wiki/Budu_(sauce))*, and *[tapai](/wiki/Tapai)*), tempoyak was probably discovered unintentionally; from the excessive unconsumed durian and thus left fermented, during the abundance of durian season in the region. Tempoyak is mentioned in [Hikayat Abdullah](/wiki/Hikayat_Abdullah) as a staple food for the people of Terengganu. When [Abdullah Abdul Kadir](/wiki/Abdullah_Abdul_Kadir) visit [Terengganu](/wiki/Terengganu) around the year 1836, he said that one of the favorite food of the local resident is Tempoyak. Based on Hikayat Abdullah, tempoyak is a food special to the [ethnic Malays](/wiki/Ethnic_Malays), and a speciality of the states of the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. [Temerloh](/wiki/Temerloh) in Pahang, Malaysia is known as the capital for *ikan patin* because of its fish farms and also its restaurants offering savoury *ikan patin masak tempoyak* (silver catfish cooked in fermented durian gravy). In Indonesia, tempoyak is exceptionally popular in [Southern Sumatra](/wiki/South_Sumatra), especially in [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang), where *tempoyak ikan patin* (pangasius fish in tempoyak sauce), and *brengkes tempoyak* (tempoyak fish in banana leaf package) is a popular local specialty. ## Indonesia In Indonesia, tempoyak is especially popular in [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang), and also in other cities and provinces in [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra) such as [Riau](/wiki/Riau), [Jambi](/wiki/Jambi), [Bengkulu](/wiki/Bengkulu), [Lampung](/wiki/Lampung) and also [Pontianak](/wiki/Pontianak,_Indonesia) in [Kalimantan](/wiki/Kalimantan). In Palembang, the dish *tempoyak ikan patin* (*[Pangasius](/wiki/Pangasius)* catfish in tempoyak sauce) and *[brengkes (pepes)](/wiki/Pepes) tempoyak* are well known, which is a steamed fermented durian paste in [banana leaf](/wiki/Banana_leaf) container, usually mixed with *patin* (*[Pangasius](/wiki/Pangasius)* fish) as *brengkes ikan patin tempoyak*. A spicy condiment called *[sambal](/wiki/Sambal) tempoyak* is made from the mixture of fermented durian, ground *[belacan](/wiki/Belacan)* (shrimp paste) and chili pepper. In [Lampung](/wiki/Lampung), tempoyak is made as *sambal seruit tempoyak*. *Seruit* is shredded fried freshwater fishes, such as *patin* (*Pangasius*), *baung* (*[Hemibagrus](/wiki/Hemibagrus)*), *lais* (*[Kryptopterus](/wiki/Kryptopterus_cryptopterus)*), *belida* ([Giant featherback](/wiki/Giant_featherback)) or *mas* ([carp](/wiki/Carp)), mixed with ground chili pepper, tomato, shallot, shrimp paste, lime juice, young unripe [mango](/wiki/Mango), salt and tempoyak. In [Pontianak](/wiki/Pontianak,_Indonesia) and [Bengkulu](/wiki/Bengkulu), tempoyak is usually served as spicy condiment as *sambal tempoyak*, mixed with red chili pepper, fresh shrimp or *teri* (anchovy) and *petai* ([green stinky bean](/wiki/Parkia_speciosa)). ## Malaysia In Malaysia, tempoyak is specifically popular in the state of [Pahang](/wiki/Pahang) and [Perak](/wiki/Perak), yet it is also can be found elsewhere, from Kuala Lumpur to [Sarawak](/wiki/Sarawak). In Malaysia, tempoyak is an essential ingredient for *[gulai](/wiki/Gulai) tempoyak ikan patin* ([pangasius](/wiki/Pangasius) fish tempoyak curry) and for cooking soup with *tang hoon* or glass noodles. [Temerloh](/wiki/Temerloh) in [Pahang](/wiki/Pahang) is known for farmed ikan patin (Shark catfish ) mostly the [Swai](/wiki/Swai) a fish known for a popular traditional dish, patin masak tempoyak (cooked with fermented durian), and another local favorites such as pais patin (grilled with tempoyak) and deep-fried with chilies. In Sarawak, tempoyak is available in the marketplace. The taste is said to be sour and salty with a lot of nutty, durian flavours. - Food portal - Indonesia portal - Malaysia portal - [List of fermented foods](/wiki/List_of_fermented_foods) - [Gulai](/wiki/Gulai) - [Minangkabau cuisine](/wiki/Minangkabau_cuisine) - [Malay cuisine](/wiki/Malay_cuisine) - [Palembang cuisine](/wiki/Palembang_cuisine) - Brengkes Tempoyak Ikan Patin recipe Palembang style steamed pangasius fish with spicy tempoyak in banana leaf package recipe, from Femina - Patin in Fermented Durian Paste (Gulai Tempoyak Ikan Patin) Archived 27 March 2019 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine), from Kuali\n",
