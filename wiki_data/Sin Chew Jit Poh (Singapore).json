  "content": "Former chinese newspaper in Singapore ***Sin Chew Jit Poh*** was a [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) [newspaper](/wiki/Newspaper). It was founded by [Aw Boon Haw](/wiki/Aw_Boon_Haw) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements). In the 1960s, it started its Malaysian bureau in [Petaling Jaya](/wiki/Petaling_Jaya), with full function printing house. The Malaysian edition started to become a separate sister [newspaper](/wiki/Newspaper) since they have the full function from news report writing to printing. Due to the [Newspaper and Printing Presses Act](/wiki/Newspaper_and_Printing_Presses_Act) enacted in 1974, starting from 1975, the two [newspapers](/wiki/Newspaper) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) and Malaysia had separate ownership. The Singapore edition was owned by Sin Chew Jit Poh (Singapore) Limited, while the [Malaysian](/wiki/Malaysia) edition was sold by [Sin Poh Amalgamated](/wiki/Sin_Poh_(Star_News)_Amalgamated) in 1982. Singapore's *Sin Chew Jit Poh* ceased publication in Singapore in March 1983 and subsequently merged with Singapore's branch of *[Nanyang Siang Pau](/wiki/Nanyang_Siang_Pau_(Singapore))* to become *[Lianhe Zaobao](/wiki/Lianhe_Zaobao)* and *[Lianhe Wanbao](/wiki/Lianhe_Wanbao)*; their parent companies, were merged in 1982 as Singapore News and Publications Limited, a predecessor of Singapore monopoly [Singapore Press Holdings](/wiki/Singapore_Press_Holdings). The Malaysian version of *Sin Chew Jit Poh* (now *[Sin Chew Daily](/wiki/Sin_Chew_Daily)*) is still in circulation. ## Gallery This article related to newspapers in Singapore is a stub.
