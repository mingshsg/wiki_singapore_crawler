  "content": "Former constituency in Singapore **Sengkang West Single Member Constituency** was a single member constituency (SMC) in the [north-eastern region](/wiki/North-East_Region,_Singapore) of Singapore. At abolition, it was managed by Ang Mo Kio Town Council. ## History Prior to the [2011 general election](/wiki/2011_Singaporean_general_election), the constituency was formed from the Sengkang West division of [Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency](/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio_Group_Representation_Constituency) (GRC). [Lam Pin Min](/wiki/Lam_Pin_Min), then the [Member of Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore#Members_of_Parliament) (MP) for said division, stood for reelection in the SMC; he defeated Koh Choong Yong from the [Workers' Party](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Singapore)) (WP) with 58.1% of the vote. In (/wiki/2015_Singaporean_general_election), part of the SMC was returned to Ang Mo Kio GRC; Lam won 62.1% of the vote in a rematch against Koh. For the [2020 general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election), the SMC was abolished and split into two parts; one was returned to Ang Mo Kio GRC, the other merged into the newly created [Sengkang GRC](/wiki/Sengkang_Group_Representation_Constituency). ## Member of Parliament YearMemberParty**Formation****2011**[Lam Pin Min](/wiki/Lam_Pin_Min)[PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)**2015****Constituency abolished (2020)** ## Electoral results Note: The [Elections Department](/wiki/Elections_Department_Singapore) does not include rejected votes when calculating the vote shares of candidates.
