It opened in 2003. The Verge has two buildings, the main building and **Chill @ The Verge**. It is located in the southern part of Little India, with the main building located on the junction of [Serangoon Road](/wiki/Serangoon_Road) and [Sungei Road](/wiki/Sungei_Road) and the Chill @ The Verge located on the junction of Perak Road and [Sungei Road](/wiki/Sungei_Road). Both of the buildings are separated by Clive Road and the mall lies opposite [Tekka Centre](/wiki/Tekka_Centre) across Serangoon Road. On 16 July 2008, the mall was revamped, which also brought about the name change from Tekka Mall to The Verge. ### Tekka Centre Tekka Centre is a relatively smaller shopping centre in Little India, Rochor.
