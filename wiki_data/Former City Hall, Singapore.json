It can be found in front of the historical [Padang](/wiki/Padang,_Singapore) and adjacent to the [Former Supreme Court of Singapore](/wiki/Former_Supreme_Court,_Singapore), it was designed and built by the architects of the [Singapore Municipal Commission](/wiki/Singapore_Municipal_Commission), A. Gordans and F. D. Meadows from 1926 to 1929. A flight of stairs takes visitors from the Corinthian colonnade to the main building. The building was constructed to replace several houses designed by [architect](/wiki/Architect) [G.D. Coleman](/wiki/G.D._Coleman). It was first known as the **Municipal Building** until 1951, when the town of Singapore was granted [city](/wiki/City) status by [King George VI](/wiki/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom). ## History The **Municipal Building** was planned and designed by the municipal architect S. D. Meadows, and then by Alexander Gordon, who took over the position in 1925. The [London](/wiki/London) construction firm Perry and Co. (Overseas) Ltd. began construction in 1926 and it was completed in 1929. By April, the Municipal Commission had moved into its new home. [Sir Hugh Clifford](/wiki/Hugh_Clifford_(colonial_administrator)), the [Governor of the Straits Settlements](/wiki/Governor_of_the_Straits_Settlements), then officially opened the new Municipal Building on 23 July 1929. During the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War), when the [Japanese occupied Singapore](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore), they managed [civic](/wiki/Civics) issues from the Municipal Building. [Political](/wiki/Politics) affairs were already being conducted in the building. In 1943, the leader of the [Indian National Army](/wiki/Indian_National_Army), [Subhas Chandra Bose](/wiki/Subhas_Chandra_Bose), rallied for Japanese support to help [India](/wiki/British_Raj) be independent of British rule at the Municipal Building. British [prisoners-of-war](/wiki/Prisoners-of-war) were rounded up in front of the building to march to POW camps such as [Changi Prison](/wiki/Changi_Prison) and Selarang. On 12 September 1945, the [Imperial Japanese Army](/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army) (IJA) official [Seishirō Itagaki](/wiki/Seishir%C5%8D_Itagaki) surrendered to [Lord Louis Mountbatten](/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma) in the building to end the Second World War in Singapore. In 1951, it was renamed to its present name **City Hall** to mark the town of Singapore being granted city status by [King George VI](/wiki/George_VI). At the time, the [City of Singapore](/wiki/City_of_Singapore_(historical_entity)) was the capital of the [Colony of Singapore](/wiki/Colony_of_Singapore). Previously, the then town of Singapore had been the capital of the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements), up until the abolition of that [Crown colony](/wiki/Crown_colony) in 1946. In 1959, then [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) declared [self-governance](/wiki/Self-governance_of_Singapore) at City Hall. It was also the first time that the people of Singapore heard the new [national anthem](/wiki/Majulah_Singapura) and saw their [national flag](/wiki/Flag_of_Singapore). Lee and his eight cabinet ministers were then sworn into political office in the [chamber](/wiki/Chambers_of_parliament) of City Hall before the first [Yang di-Pertuan Negara](/wiki/Yang_di-Pertuan_Negara), [Yusof bin Ishak](/wiki/Yusof_bin_Ishak), whose [oath](/wiki/Oath) was taken at the City Hall as well. [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) read out the Malaysia Proclamation at the City Hall in 1963, and declared that Singapore was no longer under British rule. The people celebrated the first [Malaysia Day](/wiki/Malaysia_Day) at [the Padang](/wiki/Padang,_Singapore) which was outside the City Hall. When Singapore was no longer a part of Malaysia, The first [National Day Parade](/wiki/Singapore_National_Day_Parade) was held there in 1966. The steps of the City Hall are also used as a VIP seating area when National Day Parades were held there. In 1987, the building underwent a massive upgrade to allow the building to house governmental offices. In 1988, twelve [courtrooms](/wiki/Courtroom) of the City Hall were transferred to the Supreme Court. This restoration work earned a Good Effort Award in 1994 by the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority). The City Hall was the place where Prime Minister [Goh Chok Tong](/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong) had his inauguration ceremony and the swearing-in of his [cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Singapore) in 1990. The building was also used for many government events over the years, it was used as a venue for the [Singapore Biennale](/wiki/Singapore_Biennale), and for the [IMF and World Bank Meetings](/wiki/Singapore_2006) when it was held in Singapore in 2006. Since 2015, the former City Hall, together with the adjacent [Former Supreme Court Building](/wiki/Former_Supreme_Court,_Singapore), has been the location of the [National Gallery Singapore](/wiki/National_Gallery_Singapore). - [City Hall MRT station](/wiki/City_Hall_MRT_station) - [Supreme Court of Singapore](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Singapore) - National Heritage Board (2002), *Singapore's 100 Historic Places*, Archipelago Press, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-4068-23-3 - City Hall - CDCs Archived 17 December 2018 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine)\n",
