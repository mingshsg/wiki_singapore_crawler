Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. *Find sources:* \"Datuak\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(October 2022)* **Datuk** (or **Datuak**) is a traditional, honorary title bestowed on a person by the agreement of a people or tribe in the [Minangkabau language](/wiki/Minangkabau_language), spoken by the [Minangkabau people](/wiki/Minangkabau_people) of [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia) and [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia). The title of *Datuk* was agreed upon by local, traditional leaders (*Kerapatan Adat Nagari*, abbreviated \"KAN\"). The title engenders great respect, and is only used for Minangkabau men who have become stakeholders of traditional leaders or *penghulu* (noblemen) for a particular tribe. When the title is bestowed, it is celebrated with a traditional ceremony (*Malewa Gala*) and a banquet. ## Inheritance Unlike other [Malay](/wiki/Malays_(ethnic_group)) traditions, the title of *datuk* is inherited according to the [matrilineal system](/wiki/Matrilineality). When a *datuk* dies his title may pass to his brother or nephew, whoever is closest in the maternal line. If there is no maternal relative, it may be given to another tribal member with the agreement of the tribe.[*citation needed*] If the tribe has expanded and split up into groups in other areas, it may appoint a new *datuk* by appending one or two words to the previous *datuk* title; for example, if a *datuk* name is *Datuak Bandaro* it may be expanded to *Bandaro Putiah* or *Datuak Bandaro nan Putiah* with the agreement of each tribal subgroup.[*citation needed*] ## Tradition The social status of a people in Minangkabau society may be seen from its *datuk* title. The beginning of the oldest titles usually consists of one syllable and is derived from [Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit_language) (for example, *Datuk Ketemanggungan*). Other *datuk* titles are composed of two (or more) words (for example, *Datuk Parpatiah nan Sabatang*). After the [Islamic](/wiki/Islamic) influence, the title of *datuk* is derived from [Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language). Below is a list of major *datuk* titles in Minangkabau legend and tradition: - *Datuk Ketumanggungan* - *Datuk Parpatiah nan Sabatang* - *Datuk Bandaro* - *Datuk Makhudum* - *Datuk Indomo* - *Datuk Sinaro* - [Barangay](/wiki/Barangay) - [Datu](/wiki/Datu) - [Greater India](/wiki/Greater_India) - [Hinduism in the Philippines](/wiki/Hinduism_in_the_Philippines) - [History of the Philippines (Before 1521)](/wiki/History_of_the_Philippines_(Before_1521)) - [Indian honorifics](/wiki/Indian_honorifics) – Indonesian and Malay titles originated from these - [Indosphere](/wiki/Indosphere) - [Maginoo](/wiki/Maginoo) - [Malay nobility](/wiki/Malay_nobility) - [Malay styles and titles](/wiki/Malay_styles_and_titles) - [Principalía](/wiki/Principal%C3%ADa) - [Ratu](/wiki/Ratu)\n",
