A courtesy term not enshrined in the [Constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Singapore), the spouse's role has never been [codified](/wiki/Code_of_law) or officially defined, but nevertheless figures prominently in the political and social life of Singapore. By tradition, an official [portrait](/wiki/Portrait) of the spouse of the [president of Singapore](/wiki/President_of_Singapore) is prominently displayed in government buildings and public institutions alongside the portrait of the president.
