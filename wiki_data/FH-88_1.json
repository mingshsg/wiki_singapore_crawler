  "content": "Singaporean 155 mm towed howitzer The **FH-88** or **Field Howitzer 88** was the first locally designed howitzer developed for the [Singapore Army](/wiki/Singapore_Army). It is a 155 mm/39-calibre towed howitzer gun. ## Development Ordnance Development and Engineering of Singapore (ODE, now [Singapore Technologies Kinetics](/wiki/ST_Kinetics)) began development of the FH-88 in 1983 with five prototypes being produced over a period of four years. These were followed by a preproduction batch of six 155 mm FH-88 gun-howitzers that incorporated a number of improvements as a result of trials with the prototype weapons. First production FH-88s were completed in 1987, with the weapon becoming operational with the Singapore Army the following year, replacing the [Soltam M-71](/wiki/Soltam_M-71). The howitzer was publicly presented in 1988. ## Operators - [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore): Known to use 52 FH-88s. - [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia): Known to have 5 FH-88s delivered in 1997. - [FH-2000](/wiki/FH-2000) - [SLWH Pegasus](/wiki/SLWH_Pegasus) - [SSPH Primus](/wiki/SSPH_Primus) ### Bibliography - Hogg, Ian.
