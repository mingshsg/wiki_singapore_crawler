  "content": "Southeast Asian Indian-influenced flatbread dish **Roti canai** (/tʃa'naj/), or **roti prata** (in Singapore), also known as **roti chanai** and **roti cane**, is an [unleavened](/wiki/Unleavened_bread) [flatbread](/wiki/Flatbread) of [Indian](/wiki/Indian_cuisine) origin found in the [cuisines of Southeast Asia](/wiki/Cuisine_of_Southeast_Asia), especially those of [Brunei](/wiki/Cuisine_of_Brunei), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysian_cuisine), [Singapore](/wiki/Singaporean_cuisine), and [Thailand](/wiki/Thai_cuisine). It is usually served with *[dal](/wiki/Dal)* or other types of curry but can also be cooked in a range of sweet or savoury variations made with different ingredients, such as meat, eggs, or cheese. ## Etymology *Roti canai* is attested as a kind of bread in [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) since at least 1970. *[Roti](/wiki/Roti)* is borrowed from Hindi *roṭī* 'bread'. *Canai* probably comes from Malay *canai* 'to roll dough thinly'. Less likely theories suggest that the name comes from the Indian city of [Chennai](/wiki/Chennai) or from Hindi *chana* 'chickpea, chickpea stew', which it often accompanies. In Singapore, the dish is known as *roti prata*, from the Indian *[paratha](/wiki/Paratha)* or *[parotta](/wiki/Parotta)*. ## History Since being introduced around the 19th century, roti canai has become a popular breakfast and snack dish and is one of the most common [South Indian](/wiki/South_India) foods in the region. It is said that Indians brought the dish during the era of [British Malaya](/wiki/British_Malaya). It is served in street [mamak stalls](/wiki/Mamak_stall) located in both rural and urban areas. In Southeast Asia, roti canai can often be found in cities that have populations of Indian descent, especially in Malaysia and Singapore and in northern [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra) in Indonesia. It has also been theorized that the dish had been introduced much earlier by Indian traders, in the 17th century, in Aceh and North Sumatra, under the name *roti cane*. In Indonesia, the dish is particularly found in Sumatra, where the [Indian Indonesian](/wiki/Indian_Indonesian) community is concentrated. ## Description **This section has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these messages)*This section **does not cite any sources**.

The dough is repeatedly kneaded, flattened, oiled, and folded, creating layers. The dough ball is then flattened, spread out until paper-thin (usually by \"tossing\" it on a flat surface), and gathered into a long rope-like mass. This \"rope\" is then wound into a knot or spiral and flattened, so that it consists of thin flakes of dough when cooked. When making varieties with fillings, the fillings (eggs, chopped onions, etc.) are spread or sprinkled on the thin sheet of dough, which is then folded with the fillings inside. ## Regional variations This section **possibly contains original research**.

Traditionally, roti canai is served with *[dal](/wiki/Dal)* (lentil) curry. It may also be served with the following curries: - *Kari ayam* – chicken curry - *Kari daging* – beef curry - *Kari kambing* – mutton curry - *Kari ikan* – fish curry (mostly served with *[ikan pari](/wiki/Stingray)*) - *Kari campur* – mixed curry - *Kari kacang kuda* – chickpea curry ### Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore **This section has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these messages)*This section **does not cite any sources**.

In Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore, it is usually prepared on a [griddle](/wiki/Griddle) like roti canai, but in Indonesia, it is often deep-fried in a wok and very oily. In Thailand, it is called \"mataba\". In Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, murtabak is made using the same dough used for roti canai, and on the same equipment, in the same shops. Most murtabak in Malaysia tend to have less minced meat and more egg than Singaporean murtabak or [Johorean](/wiki/Johor) murtabak. Murtabak cheese is a variation, with added mozzarella cheese. - *Roti telur*, with an egg (*telur*) stuffing - *Roti jantan*, roti telur with two-egg stuffing - *Roti bawang*, with onion (*bawang*) stuffing - *Roti telur bawang*, with eggs and onions - *Roti boom* (or *bom*; 'bomb bread'), a smaller but thicker roti, with the dough wound in a spiral; served with sugar and margarine, or with curry. - *Roti planta*, stuffed with margarine (often [Planta Margarine](/wiki/Planta_Margarine)) and sugar - *Roti sardin*, stuffed with canned [sardine](/wiki/Sardines_as_food), with or without egg, and sometimes mixed with ketchup or *[sambal](/wiki/Sambal)*, similar to murtabak - *Roti pisang*, stuffed with sliced bananas - *Roti sayur*, stuffed with shredded or sliced vegetables - *Roti salad*, raw shredded vegetables rolled up with a piece of roti - *[Roti tissue](/wiki/Roti_tissue)/roti tisu*, a tissue-paper-thin and flaky roti, usually with sprinkled sugar and condensed milk. Also called *roomali roti*, from *roomal* ([Hindi](/wiki/Hindi), meaning 'handkerchief'). - *Roti kaya*, with *[kaya](/wiki/Coconut_jam)* spread - *Roti maggi*, stuffed with prepared instant noodles, usually [Maggi](/wiki/Maggi) brand - *Roti cheese*, stuffed with cheese - *Roti milo*, stuffed with [Milo](/wiki/Milo_(drink)) powder - *Roti cobra*, served with curry chicken and a piece of fried egg on top - *Roti banjir* (\"flooded roti\"), usually chopped into pieces, with curry poured over the top - *Roti tsunami*, roti banjir with added sambal and soft-boiled eggs - *Roti Doll* (\"Doll's roti\"), roti banjir with added sambal and a fried egg on top. Most commonly found in northern Malaysia, especially in the town of [Alor Setar](/wiki/Alor_Setar); named after a customer. - *Roti Sarang Burung* (\"bird's nest roti\"), roti cooked in a doughnut shape with a fried egg in the hole, similar to [egg in the basket](/wiki/Egg_in_the_basket) and [khachapuri](/wiki/Khachapuri). *Roti prata* in Singapore and southern Malaysia is a fried flatbread that is cooked over a flat grilling pan. It is usually served with sugar or a vegetable- or meat-based curry and is also commonly cooked with cheese, onions, bananas, red beans, chocolate, mushrooms, or eggs. Roti prata is prepared by flipping the dough into a large thin layer before folding the outside edges inwards. The dough is cooked on a flat, round iron pan measuring about three feet in diameter. The cooking process lasts two to five minutes. - *Roti tampal* or *roti plaster* (in Singapore): the roti is plastered on one side with egg, with the yolk left runny or totally cooked. ### Indonesia *Roti cane* came to Indonesia via Muslim Indian migration to [Aceh Sultanate](/wiki/Aceh_Sultanate), in the northern parts of Sumatra, around the 17th century, and later to the rest of the [Dutch East Indies](/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies), in the early 19th century. It has since been adopted into the [Malay](/wiki/Malay_cuisine), [Acehnese](/wiki/Acehnese_cuisine), and [Minangkabau cuisine](/wiki/Minangkabau_cuisine) of Sumatra. Consequently, there are Malay, Acehnese, and Minangkabau restaurants serving the dish with mutton curry that are operated by ethnic groups other than Indians. Two types of popular *roti cane* dishes include sweet *roti cane*, served with various toppings such as cheese, chocolate [sprinkles](/wiki/Sprinkles), and [chocolate syrup](/wiki/Chocolate_syrup); and savoury *roti cane*, served with curry sauce. Today in Indonesia, roti canai is often associated with Acehnese cuisine, despite its Indian origin. In [Ampel](/wiki/Ampel), an [Arab](/wiki/Arab_Indonesian_cuisine) quarter in [Surabaya](/wiki/Surabaya), the dish is known as *roti maryam*, while the Javanese call it *roti konde*, after its shape, which resembles a hairbun ([Javanese](/wiki/Javanese_language): *konde*). Despite having different names, each variant is derivative of the Indian *paratha* and is similar in preparation. Indian-influenced roti is typically served with *[kari kambing](/wiki/Mutton_curry)* (mutton curry). ### Thailand This section **does not cite any sources**.

In other parts of Thailand, roti is also commonly eaten with mango, banana, sugar, [condensed milk](/wiki/Condensed_milk), jam, [peanut butter](/wiki/Peanut_butter), or [Nutella](/wiki/Nutella), although plain egg roti is also available. ## Gallery - Asia portal - Food portal - Malaysia portal - Indonesia portal - Singapore portal - Thailand portal - [Crêpe](/wiki/Cr%C3%AApe) - [Goat roti](/wiki/Goat_roti) - [Roti jala](/wiki/Roti_jala) - [Naan](/wiki/Naan) - Roti prata video recipe - Roti Prata, [Singapore Infopedia](/wiki/Singapore_Infopedia), [National Library Board](/wiki/National_Library_Board), Singapore (archived)\n",
