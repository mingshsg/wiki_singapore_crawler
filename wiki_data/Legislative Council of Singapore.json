It officially came into existence in 1946, when the Straits Settlements (Repeal) Act 1946 abolished the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements), and made Singapore a [Crown colony](/wiki/Crown_colony) that would need its own legislative council. Based on existing systems already in place when the council operated under the Straits Settlements, it was partially opened for [public voting](/wiki/Election) in 1948, before being replaced by the [Legislative Assembly](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore) in 1953. ## History ### Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements (1867–1942) The [Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_the_Straits_Settlements) was formed on 1 April 1867 when the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements) was made a [Crown Colony](/wiki/Crown_colony) that answered directly to the [Secretary of State for the Colonies](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies) in [London](/wiki/London), instead of the [Calcutta](/wiki/Calcutta) colonial government based in [India](/wiki/British_India). [Letters patent](/wiki/Letters_patent) granted a **Colonial Constitution** on 4 February, which allocated much power to the governor. He was assisted by an [Executive Council](/wiki/Executive_Council_(Commonwealth_countries)) and Legislative Council, the latter of which was entrusted with law-making in the colony. However, the governor had a casting vote and the power of assent and [veto](/wiki/Veto) on all bills. The Legislative Council was composed of members of the Executive Council, the [chief justice](/wiki/Chief_justice), and non-official members nominated by the governor. These nominated members were intended to better represent the local people, including in its ranks [Asian](/wiki/Asia) members. Mostly wealthy Asian business and professional leaders, they were not necessarily a fair representation of the locals, however. Starting with four members, it started to grow through the years, with Singaporean members increasingly dominating the council to the displeasure of the politicians from [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca) and [Penang](/wiki/Penang). Despite this control by British subjects of the European [race](/wiki/Race_(classification_of_human_beings)), the local Asian population was usually [apathetic](/wiki/Apathy) about such control. There have been a few exceptions. [Tan Cheng Lock](/wiki/Tan_Cheng_Lock), a member of the Executive Council who had previously opposed several policies made by the Legislative Council – such as the Aliens Ordinance of 1933 which restricted immigration – as anti-Chinese, called for direct popular representation through [popular votes](/wiki/Election), and to increase the number of non-official members to form a majority in the Legislative Council. Initiatives like these were unsuccessful, however, as there was little support from wider society were widely apathetic to local politics, with the Chinese population paying more attention towards growing their commercial and professional interests, and the events occurring back in [China](/wiki/China), fueled largely by the rise in Chinese [nationalism](/wiki/Nationalism) sentiments. ### Legislative Council of the Colony of Singapore (1946–1955) After [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II), the Straits Settlements (Repeal) Act of 1946 dissolved the Straits Settlements, with Singapore becoming a Crown Colony on its own while [Penang](/wiki/Penang) and [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca) joined the [Malayan Union](/wiki/Malayan_Union). The effects of the war led to major changes in attitudes towards the British colonial government, particularly with the drop in confidence in their ability to govern and protect Singapore, and a resulting desire to have greater say and participation in local affairs. With mounting local pressure, a new Colonial Constitution was passed, with the Singapore Colony Order-in-Council of 1946 to 1948 providing for public voting to take place for the first time with the [first general election of 1948](/wiki/1948_Singapore_general_election). Elected members of the Legislative Council were restricted to only six non-official members, however, voting was only open to adult British subjects who had been residents in Singapore for at least a year before the elections. The rest of the thirteen non-officials including four nominated members by the governor and three by the [chambers of commerce](/wiki/Chambers_of_commerce). Nine official members complete the council. The governor continued to exercise significant power, included the right to veto bills by the council. ## List of sessions Legislative CouncilCommencedSessionSession datesDissolvedBy-elections1st ((/wiki/1948_Singaporean_general_election))1 April 19481st16 February 1951(/wiki/1948_Rural_West_by-election)2nd3rd4th16 January 1951 – 16 February 19512nd ((/wiki/1951_Singaporean_general_election))17 April 19511st17 April 1951 – 18 December 19515 February 1955(/wiki/1952_Seletar_by-election)2nd19 February 1952 – 16 December 19523rd24 February 1953 – 15 December 19534th16 March 1954 – 29 January 1955 ## Successor legislatures - [Legislative Assembly of Singapore](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore) → [Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore) - The road to Singaporean independence - Timeline of Parliament - Singaporean history\n",
