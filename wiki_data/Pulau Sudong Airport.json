  "content": "Airport in Pulau Sudong **Pulau Sudong Airport** is a military airstrip used by the [Republic of Singapore Air Force](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force) (RSAF) on [Sudong Island](/wiki/Pulau_Sudong). It has a singular asphalt runway of 7,999 feet (2,438 m) in length and is located 7 metres (23 ft) above [mean sea level](/wiki/Height_above_mean_sea_level) (MSL). It is maintained by the RSAF year-round by a crew of workers that visit the island regularly. ## History Pulau Sudong was originally a smaller island with a civilian population. It was later reclaimed and gazetted for military use, with its residents relocated to [mainland Singapore](/wiki/Mainland_Singapore) during the 1970s. In 1989, the [Singapore Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces) (SAF) officially designated the island as one of its live-firing areas, and in 1994, a runway was constructed by a company called L&M to support military operations. ### Runway extension In 2024, the government announced plans to extend and upgrade the runway on Pulau Sudong to enhance safety for military aircraft, particularly during emergencies and [bad weather conditions](/wiki/Instrument_meteorological_conditions). To reduce the environmental impact of the project, rare and vulnerable species will be relocated and habitat restoration efforts will be undertaken after the reclamation is completed by 2028. - [List of airports in Singapore](/wiki/List_of_airports_in_Singapore) - [Western Islands](/wiki/Western_Islands,_Singapore) This article about transport in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) is a stub.
