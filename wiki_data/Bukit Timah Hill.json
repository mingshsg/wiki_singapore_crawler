  "content": "Tallest hill in Singapore **Bukit Timah Hill** is the highest natural peak in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It is located in [Bukit Panjang](/wiki/Bukit_Panjang) rather than its namesake district and its altitude is 164 metres (538 feet) above sea level. ## Altitude The hill's 164-metre (538 ft) altitude makes it the highest natural peak in Singapore. The highest *point* in Singapore, however, is the 284-metre (932 ft) [Guoco Tower](/wiki/Guoco_Tower), one of [scores of buildings](/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Singapore) taller than the hill. ## Location and accessibility The hill is located in the Nature Reserve subzone of [Bukit Panjang](/wiki/Bukit_Panjang) rather than its namesake district of [Bukit Timah](/wiki/Bukit_Timah), near the geographical centre of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It is accessible via [Hillview MRT station](/wiki/Hillview_MRT_station) on the [Downtown MRT line](/wiki/Downtown_Line). The hill is now protected as part of the [Bukit Timah Nature Reserve](/wiki/Bukit_Timah_Nature_Reserve), which has been classified as an [ASEAN Heritage Park](/wiki/ASEAN_Heritage_Park). The hill's paved maintenance road (leading to the hill's pair of 60 m (200 ft) VHF steel lattice [radio masts](/wiki/Radio_mast) built in the 1960s), is not open to the public. Public access is provided by several walking trails. ## Climate This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Due to its low to moderate elevation, the weather is slightly cooler than the rest of Singapore and strong winds sometimes occur at the peak.
