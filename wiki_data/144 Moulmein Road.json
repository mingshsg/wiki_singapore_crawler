  "content": "Bungalow in Novena, Singapore **144 Moulmein Road** is a bungalow on Moulmein Road in [Novena, Singapore](/wiki/Novena,_Singapore). It currently houses the Tuberculosis Control Unit. ## Description The single-storey building is elevated above the ground with masonry piers to protect against flooding, as well as to provide additional ventilation. According to the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority), the building's design is \"adapted from traditional South East Asian/Malay architecture.\" Two \"distinctive\" octagonal turrets built in the [Queen Anne Revival style](/wiki/British_Queen_Anne_Revival_architecture) can be found on either side of the front. The porch features masonry columns of the [Doric order](/wiki/Doric_order). Mouldings around the windows, porch pediment and above the front door depict Chinese bats and coins. The building features the standard Malay house plan, with a verandah, known as a serambi, at the front of the bungalow and a central section, known as a rumah ibu, which leads to the rear section of the bungalow. ## History The house served as the residence of Hakka businessman Lim Soo Ban, who died in December 1952. The Tuberculosis Control Unit of the nearby [Tan Tock Seng Hospital](/wiki/Tan_Tock_Seng_Hospital) moved into the building in the late 1950s. It was also used as a chapel for the staff of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It was gazetted for conservation by the Urban Redevelopment Authority on 6 June 2014, along with 142 Moulmein Road and the Former Nurses' Quarters of the hospital. 1°19′10″N 103°50′51″E﻿ / ﻿1.31944°N 103.84753°E﻿ / 1.31944; 103.84753\n",
