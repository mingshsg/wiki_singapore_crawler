  "content": "Cabinet of Singapore from 2011 to 2015 The **Third Cabinet of Lee Hsien Loong** of the [Government](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore) of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) came into existence on 21 May 2011 following the [2011 general election](/wiki/2011_Singaporean_general_election). While many of its members were retained from the [previous government](/wiki/Second_Lee_Hsien_Loong_Cabinet), [Heng Swee Keat](/wiki/Heng_Swee_Keat) and [Chan Chun Sing](/wiki/Chan_Chun_Sing), who had both just been elected, were given ministerial appointments. With effect from 1 August 2012, [Grace Fu](/wiki/Grace_Fu) became only the second woman in Singapore's history to be made a full minister by being appointed a Minister in the [Prime Minister's Office](/wiki/Prime_Minister%27s_Office_(Singapore)). (The first was [Lim Hwee Hua](/wiki/Lim_Hwee_Hua).) From 1 November, Chan Chun Sing assumed the designation of [Acting Minister for Social and Family Development](/wiki/Ministry_of_Social_and_Family_Development), while [Lawrence Wong](/wiki/Lawrence_Wong) was brought into the Cabinet for the first time as Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth. ## Initial composition ### Cabinet At the 2011 general election, Senior Minister [Shunmugam Jayakumar](/wiki/S._Jayakumar_(Singaporean_politician)) did not contest his seat as part of the [East Coast Group Representation Constituency](/wiki/East_Coast_Group_Representation_Constituency) and thus retired from the Cabinet. Foreign Minister [George Yeo](/wiki/George_Yeo) and Minister in the Prime Minister's Office [Lim Hwee Hua](/wiki/Lim_Hwee_Hua) contested [Aljunied GRC](/wiki/Aljunied_Group_Representation_Constituency) unsuccessfully, and were defeated by a team from the [Workers' Party of Singapore](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_Singapore). Following the election, on 14 May 2011, Minister Mentor [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) and Senior Minister [Goh Chok Tong](/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong) tendered their resignations from the Cabinet, stating that they wished to give the Prime Minister a \"fresh clean slate\" in forming the Government and enable him to \"have a completely younger team of ministers to connect to and engage with this young generation\". Goh was given the honorary title of Emeritus Senior Minister; the same title was offered to Lee but he declined. Lee and Goh were appointed as senior advisers to the [Government of Singapore Investment Corporation](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore_Investment_Corporation) (GIC) and the [Monetary Authority of Singapore](/wiki/Monetary_Authority_of_Singapore) (MAS) respectively. Four days later, on 18 May, Prime Minister [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) announced a new Cabinet line-up. In addition to Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Chok Tong, George Yeo and Lim Hwee Hua, four other ministers retired: [Wong Kan Seng](/wiki/Wong_Kan_Seng), [Mah Bow Tan](/wiki/Mah_Bow_Tan), [Lim Boon Heng](/wiki/Lim_Boon_Heng) and [Raymond Lim](/wiki/Raymond_Lim). Two ministers, [Lim Hng Kiang](/wiki/Lim_Hng_Kiang) and [Lim Swee Say](/wiki/Lim_Swee_Say), retained their respective [Trade and Industry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Trade_and_Industry_(Singapore)) and Prime Minister's Office portfolios, while existing ministers were appointed to new positions in the remaining 11 ministries. [Tharman Shanmugaratnam](/wiki/Tharman_Shanmugaratnam) was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister and appointed [Minister for Manpower](/wiki/Ministry_of_Manpower_(Singapore)) in addition to his portfolio of [Minister for Finance](/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Singapore)), replacing Wong Kan Seng. [S. Iswaran](/wiki/S._Iswaran), formerly Senior Minister of State for Education and for Trade and Industry, was elevated to the Cabinet as Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, and [Second Minister for Home Affairs](/wiki/Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(Singapore)) and for Trade and Industry. [Heng Swee Keat](/wiki/Heng_Swee_Keat) and [Chan Chun Sing](/wiki/Chan_Chun_Sing), both elected to Parliament for the first time, were respectively assigned the posts of [Minister for Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)), and [Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports](/wiki/Ministry_of_Community_Development,_Youth_and_Sports) and Minister of State for the [Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts](/wiki/Ministry_of_Information,_Communications_and_the_Arts).
