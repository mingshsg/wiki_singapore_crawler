  "content": "Playing field in Singapore **The Padang** ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) for 'field'), formerly known as **The Plain** and **The Esplanade**, is an open playing field located within the [Downtown Core](/wiki/Downtown_Core) of the [Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore) in Singapore. It includes the [Padang Cricket Ground](/wiki/Singapore_Cricket_Club_Ground). ## Background The Padang is surrounded by several important landmarks, which include [Saint Andrew's Cathedral](/wiki/Saint_Andrew%27s_Cathedral,_Singapore), [City Hall](/wiki/Former_City_Hall,_Singapore), the [Old Supreme Court Building](/wiki/Former_Supreme_Court,_Singapore) and the [City Hall MRT station](/wiki/City_Hall_MRT_station). From the 1830s to the early 20th century, the Padang was known as the Esplanade. ## History This section **needs expansion**. You can help by expanding it. *(March 2023)* As the only open plain in the area, the Padang was chosen by [William Farquhar](/wiki/William_Farquhar) as the location of the British encampment in Singapore on 28 January 1819. The Padang was used as a public recreational space since at least the 1830s. For most of its existence, it was used as pitch for cricket, football and rugby matches. In 1852, the [Singapore Cricket Club](/wiki/Singapore_Cricket_Club) was formed and a clubhouse built on the western edge of the Padang. In 1884, the [Singapore Recreation Club](/wiki/Singapore_Recreation_Club) erected its clubhouse on the opposite end of the green. In 1887, to commemorate the [Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria](/wiki/Golden_Jubilee_of_Queen_Victoria), a bronze statue of [Sir Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles) was erected in the centre of the Padang. It was later removed in 1919 by the Municipal Council to outside [Victoria Memorial Hall](/wiki/Victoria_Memorial_Hall), where it currently stands. During the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War), the Japanese used the Padang as a gathering point for European and [Eurasians](/wiki/Eurasian_Singaporeans) before they were marched to internment camps on the island. [Subhas Chandra Bose](/wiki/Subhas_Chandra_Bose)'s [Indian National Army](/wiki/Indian_National_Army) held their parades there in June 1945. Due to its prime location and historical significance, it has been used as a venue for a variety of events. It was the first host of the [Singapore National Day parade](/wiki/Singapore_National_Day_parade) (NDP), and has hosted it on a regular cycle (every three years from 1984 to 1994, every five years since) and during years that mark national milestones (such as the [bicentennial of modern Singapore](/wiki/Founding_years_of_modern_Singapore) in 2019). From 2023 through 2025, it will host the parade due to the reconstruction of its designated main venue [The Float @ Marina Bay](/wiki/The_Float_@_Marina_Bay) as [NS Square](/wiki/NS_Square). On 4 November 2018, the Padang hosted the live finals of the [Mandopop](/wiki/Mandopop) reality music competition *[SPOP Sing!](/wiki/SPOP_Sing!)*. On 3 August 2019, [Deputy Prime Minister](/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) [Heng Swee Keat](/wiki/Heng_Swee_Keat) announced that the Padang will be gazetted as a [National Monument](/wiki/List_of_national_monuments_of_Singapore) along with the [Anderson Bridge](/wiki/Anderson_Bridge_(Singapore)), [Cavenagh Bridge](/wiki/Cavenagh_Bridge) and the [Elgin Bridge](/wiki/Elgin_Bridge_(Singapore)) (collectively known as the Singapore River Bridges), due to the historical significance - these include the World War II surrender in 1945, National Day Parade and the signing of the country's formation in the British colony and self-independence. The Preservation of Monuments (Amendment) Act will allow open spaces or the whole of the area to be gazetted as national monuments, such as [Fort Siloso](/wiki/Fort_Siloso) and Padang. On 8 August 2022, it was announced that the Padang would be gazetted as the nation's 75th national monument on 9 August, the 57th anniversary of the Republic's independence. ## Gallery - [INA at Padang](/wiki/Indian_National_Army_in_Singapore) - Victor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2004), *Toponymics – A Study of Singapore Street Names*, Eastern University Press, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-210-364-3\n",
