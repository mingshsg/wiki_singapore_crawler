She quit her job in business development to launch an acting career in Hong Kong. In 1996, she was offered HK$20 million to pose nude and rejected the offer. She was the first female from Singapore to be nominated for a Hong Kong Film Award in 1997 for her role in *[Island of Greed](/wiki/Island_of_Greed)*. In 2000, she was featured in [Wong Kar-wai](/wiki/Wong_Kar-wai)'s award-winning film *[In The Mood For Love](/wiki/In_The_Mood_For_Love)* but most of her scenes were not put into the final cut. She has worked in many commercials for ATV and beauty products in an effort to further advance her career. She is lesser known than her acting peers in Hong Kong despite her efforts. She can fluently speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese and has used all four languages in her roles. Sun has said during the DVD documentary for [Ichi the Killer](/wiki/Ichi_the_Killer_(film)) that her nickname \"Alien Sun\" was given to her by classmates in school who made fun of her for having a head that was slightly disproportionately larger than her body during childhood. In 2012, Sun returned to the media industry after a 10 years break. Sun has two sons, one born in 2004 and one born in 2008, with her former boyfriend. ## Filmography - *[Project Gutenberg](/wiki/Project_Gutenberg_(film))* (2018) - *[The Vanished Murderer](/wiki/The_Vanished_Murderer)* (2015) - *[Insanity](/wiki/Insanity_(2015_film))* (2015) - *[Sara](/wiki/Sara_(2015_film))* (2015) - *Hardcore Comedy* (2013) - *May We Chat* (2013) - *A Wedding Or A Funeral* (2004) - Shirley - *[Fu bo](/wiki/Fu_Bo_(film))* (2003) - *[Bless The Child](/wiki/Bless_the_Child_(2003_film))* (2003) - *[Sun Wukong](/wiki/Sun_Wukong)* (2002) (TV Series) - The Spider Evil - *Every Dog Has His Date* (2001) - Cathy - *[The Accidental Spy](/wiki/The_Accidental_Spy)* (2001) - (looking at gym instruments) - *[Ichi the Killer](/wiki/Ichi_the_Killer_(film))* (2001) - Karen - *[In the Mood for Love](/wiki/In_the_Mood_for_Love)* (2000) (voice) - Mrs. Chow - *[Last Ghost Standing](/wiki/Last_Ghost_Standing)* (1999) - Officer Suen - *[Troublesome Night 4](/wiki/Troublesome_Night_4)* (1998) - Apple - *Love & Sex of the Eastern Hollywood* (1998) - Selina/Pink - *[The Untold Story 2](/wiki/The_Untold_Story_2)* (1998) - Fung - *[Island of Greed](/wiki/Island_of_Greed)* (1997) - Tsui Miu-Heung - *Killing Me Hardly* (1997) - Starry - *[Up for the Rising Sun](/wiki/Up_for_the_Rising_Sun)* (1997) - *Mr. Mumble* (1996) - Sharon - *Love and Sex Among the Ruins* (1996) - Madam Ron - *Lover's Tears* (1996) - - *[Banana Club](/wiki/Banana_Club)* (1996) - Vee - *[Sixty Million Dollar Man](/wiki/Sixty_Million_Dollar_Man)* (1995) - Bonnie - *Lover's Tears* (1995) - Kam Hing - *[The Golden Girls](/wiki/The_Golden_Girls_(1995_film))* (1995) - May Chu - *Doug's Choice* (1994) This biography article about an Asian contestant in a beauty pageant is a stub.
