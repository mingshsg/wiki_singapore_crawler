  "content": "Indonesian, Malaysian and Singaporean curry dish **Fish head curry** ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language): ***kari kepala ikan***) is a dish in [Malaysian](/wiki/Malaysian_cuisine) and [Singaporean cuisines](/wiki/Singaporean_cuisine) with mixed Indian and Chinese origins. The [head](/wiki/Fish_head) of a [red snapper](/wiki/Lutjanus) is [stewed](/wiki/Stew) in a [Kerala](/wiki/Kerala)-style [curry](/wiki/Curry) with assorted vegetables such as [okra](/wiki/Okra) and [eggplants](/wiki/Eggplant). It is usually served with either rice or bread, or as a shared dish. ## Description It is believed that fish head curry was invented when chef M.J. Gomez from [Kerala, India](/wiki/Kerala,_India) adopted the dish to bring [South Indian cuisine](/wiki/South_Indian_cuisine) to diners in Singapore. Although fish head was not widely served in India, Chinese customers considered it to be a [special delicacy](/wiki/Fish_head_casserole), so M.J. had the idea of cooking the fish in curry instead. The dish was first sold in 1949, at the restaurant opened by Gomez. Today, Indian, [Malay](/wiki/Malay_cuisine), Chinese, and [Peranakan](/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine) restaurants all serve variations of this dish. Fish head curry has become a popular dish among Singaporeans and tourists alike. Costing between $10 and $20, it is generally not considered cheap [hawker](/wiki/Hawker_centre) fare. It typically comes served in a clay pot, and is often sold at hawker centers and neighbourhood food stalls.[*citation needed*] ## Preparation [Tamarind](/wiki/Tamarind) (asam) juice is frequently added to the gravy to give the dish a [sweet-sour](/wiki/Sweet_and_sour) flavor (see [asam fish](/wiki/Asam_fish)). This variety of fish head curry also has a thinner, orange gravy. [Coconut milk](/wiki/Coconut_milk) can be added to this dish. - Food portal - Malaysia portal - Singapore portal - [Malay cuisine](/wiki/Malay_cuisine) - [Minangkabau cuisine](/wiki/Minangkabau_cuisine) - [Peranakan cuisine](/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine) - [Singaporean cuisine](/wiki/Singaporean_cuisine) - [Malabar matthi curry](/wiki/Malabar_matthi_curry) - [Fish head casserole](/wiki/Fish_head_casserole) - [Fish amok](/wiki/Fish_amok) - [Fish stew](/wiki/Fish_stew) - [Fish curry](/wiki/Fish_curry_(disambiguation)) (disambiguation)\n",
