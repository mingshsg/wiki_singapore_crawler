  "content": "Southeast Asian pastry dish **Kueh pie tee** or **kuih jambang** is a thin and crispy pastry tart shell [kuih](/wiki/Kuih) often filled with a spicy, sweet mixture of thinly sliced vegetables and prawns. It is a popular Malay and [Peranakan](/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine) dish, often consumed during occasions like tea parties, weddings or [Chinese New Year](/wiki/Chinese_New_Year). ## History ### Names The phrase *pie tee* (or *pai ti* or *pai tee*) may have been derived from the English term 'patty'; particularly 'patty irons': special cast iron molds used for making pastries similar to [rosettes](/wiki/Rosette_(cookie)) which can be found similarly such as in Sweden (*krustadjärn*, \"[croustade](/wiki/Croustade) iron\"), which have been introduced to Singapore in the 1900s. The *jambang* in kuih jambang means 'vase' in the local [Singaporean Malay dialect](/wiki/Malay_Singaporeans#Dialects_and_languages). In [Malaysian English](/wiki/Malaysian_English), they are sometimes known as '[tophats](/wiki/Top_hat)'. ### Spread The dish may have been of Western origin and invented in the 20th century. Singaporean historian Khir Johari researched that Malay Singaporeans may have acquired the knowledge for their kuih jambang from 1950s Indonesian cookbooks which lists *frituurtjes or kwei patti* filed with chicken \"[ragout](/wiki/Ragout)\" as a \"European dish\" (*makanan Eropah*). The localised kuih jambang however uses a filling similar to that of the [popiah](/wiki/Popiah), and Singaporean recipe books like [Ellice Handy](/wiki/Ellice_Handy)'s *My Favourite Recipes* (1952) features both the popiah and pie tee side-by-side with her Pie Tee recipe contains only instructions to make the shells. Peranakan writer Baba Ong Jin Teong has also suggested in his Peranakan heritage books that the *kueh pie tee* may have originated in Singapore. The recipe found in Ong's book *Penang Heritage Food* belongs to his mother, who compiled the recipe in the 1950s. Additionally, the *kueh pie tee* is also known as the 'Singapore Poh Piah' or '[Syonan](/wiki/Syonan)-to Pie', further suggesting that the snack may have originated from Singapore. ## Making The shells are made of flour, and the batter may be added with [slaked lime](/wiki/Calcium_hydroxide#Asian_uses) or [carbonated water](/wiki/Carbonated_water) for more crunch. Though some stores will make them from scratch, they can usually be found ready-made in most supermarkets. Similar to *[popiah](/wiki/Popiah)*, the Peranakan pai tee filling is shredded [jicama](/wiki/Jicama) and carrots, and usually these two dishes are sold by the same stall in [hawker centres](/wiki/Hawker_centre). The Malay kuih jambang, however, is often filled with spiced beef and topped with chives, chilies and onions. - [Kue](/wiki/Kue) - [Chinese Indonesian cuisine](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian_cuisine) - [Malay cuisine](/wiki/Malay_cuisine) - [Peranakan cuisine](/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine) Portals: - Food - Indonesia - Malaysia - Singapore\n",
