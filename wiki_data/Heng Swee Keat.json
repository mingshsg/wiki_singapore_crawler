  "content": "Singaporean politician (born 1961) **Heng Swee Keat**[a][b] [PPA](/wiki/Pingat_Pentadbiran_Awam) [PJG](/wiki/Pingat_Jasa_Gemilang) (born 15 April 1961) is a Singaporean former politician and police officer who served as the [Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore](/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) between 2019 and 2025. He was the [Member of Parliament](/wiki/Member_of_Parliament_(Singapore)) (MP) for the Tampines Central division of [Tampines Group Representation Constituency](/wiki/Tampines_Group_Representation_Constituency) (GRC) between 2011 and 2020 and the Bedok division of [East Coast GRC](/wiki/East_Coast_GRC) between 2020 and 2025. Heng had previously served as [Minister for Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)) between 2011 and 2015, as [Minister for Finance](/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Singapore)) between 2015 and 2021, and as [Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies](/wiki/Coordinating_Minister_for_Economic_Policies) between 2020 and 2024. Prior to entering politics, Heng worked in the [Singapore Police Force](/wiki/Singapore_Police_Force) (SPF), [Ministry of Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)) (MOE), [Ministry of Trade and Industry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Trade_and_Industry_(Singapore)) (MTI), and [Monetary Authority of Singapore](/wiki/Monetary_Authority_of_Singapore) (MAS). He was also the [principal private secretary](/wiki/Private_secretary) to Senior Minister [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) between 1997 and 2001. Heng made his political debut in the [2011 general election](/wiki/2011_Singaporean_general_election) as part of a five-member PAP team contesting in Tampines GRC and won with 57.22% of the vote. He was then elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Tampines Central ward of Tampines GRC and managed to retain his parliamentary seat in the [2015 general election](/wiki/2015_Singaporean_general_election) with 72.06% of the vote before switching to contest in East Coast GRC in the [2020 general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election). Heng was poised to succeed [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) as the fourth [prime minister of Singapore](/wiki/Prime_minister_of_Singapore) following his appointment as Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore in May 2019 and First Assistant Secretary-General of the People's Action Party in November 2018. However, he withdrew himself from consideration in April 2021. ## Education Heng was educated at [Raffles Institution](/wiki/Raffles_Institution) before graduating from [Christ's College](/wiki/Christ%27s_College,_Cambridge) at the [University of Cambridge](/wiki/University_of_Cambridge) in 1983 with a [Bachelor of Arts](/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts) with honours (later promoted to [Master of Arts](/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(Oxford,_Cambridge,_and_Dublin)) by seniority) degree in [economics](/wiki/Economics) after being conferred an overseas scholarship from the [Singapore Police Force](/wiki/Singapore_Police_Force) (SPF) in 1980. Heng returned to the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and served in various roles, including a five-year stint in the [Criminal Investigation Department](/wiki/Criminal_Investigation_Department_(Singapore)) (CID), before leaving in 1997 with the rank of [Assistant Commissioner](/wiki/Assistant_commissioner_of_police). He also completed a nine-month Command and Staff Course conducted by the [Singapore Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces) (SAF). He subsequently went on to complete a [Master of Public Administration](/wiki/Master_of_Public_Administration) degree at [Harvard University](/wiki/Harvard_University)'s [John F. Kennedy School of Government](/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_School_of_Government) in 1993. ## Civil Service career Heng joined the Singapore Administrative Service in 1997 and worked at the [Ministry of Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)) (MOE) before being appointed [Principal Private Secretary](/wiki/Private_secretary) to [Senior Minister](/wiki/Senior_Minister_of_Singapore) [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) that same year. In 2001, Heng was appointed [Permanent Secretary](/wiki/Permanent_secretary) at the [Ministry of Trade and Industry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Trade_and_Industry_(Singapore)) (MTI). From 1 June 2005 to 2 April 2011, he served as Managing Director of the [Monetary Authority of Singapore](/wiki/Monetary_Authority_of_Singapore) (MAS), and was named Asia-Pacific Central Bank Governor of the Year by *[The Banker](/wiki/The_Banker)* in February 2011. ## Political career ### 2011–2015 Heng made his political debut in the [2011 general election](/wiki/2011_Singaporean_general_election) as part of the five-member PAP team contesting in [Tampines GRC](/wiki/Tampines_Group_Representation_Constituency), with former [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) [Goh Chok Tong](/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong) claiming that Heng had the potential to become a Cabinet minister. The PAP team won with 57.22% of the vote against the [National Solidarity Party](/wiki/National_Solidarity_Party_(Singapore)) and Heng became a Member of Parliament representing the [Tampines Central](/wiki/Tampines) ward of Tampines GRC. On 18 May 2011, Heng was appointed to the [Cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Singapore) as [Minister for Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)). In August 2012, he was tasked with leading a [new ministerial committee](/wiki/Our_Singapore_Conversation) to conduct a broad-based review of the government's policies and direction. ### 2015–2020 During the [2015 general election](/wiki/2015_Singaporean_general_election), Heng led the five-member PAP team contesting in Tampines GRC and won 72.06% of the vote against the [National Solidarity Party](/wiki/National_Solidarity_Party_(Singapore)). After the general election, on 1 October 2015, Heng relinquished his portfolio as [Minister for Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)) and took up the position of [Minister for Finance](/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Singapore)). On 19 February 2018, Heng announced during a budget speech in [Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore) that the government planned to raise the [Goods and Services Tax](/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(Singapore)) (GST) from 7% to 9% sometime between 2021 and 2025. He said that, \"the GST increase is necessary because even after exploring various options to manage our future expenditures through prudent spending, saving and borrowing for infrastructure, there is still a gap\". On 1 May 2018, Heng took over the responsibility of assisting [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) on the National Research Foundation matters from [Deputy Prime Minister](/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) [Teo Chee Hean](/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean). Later that year, on 23 November, he replaced Teo as the first assistant secretary-general of the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) following an election in the party's [Central Executive Committee](/wiki/Central_Executive_Committee_(PAP)) (CEC). On 1 May 2019, Heng was appointed [Deputy Prime Minister](/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Singapore), taking over the office which had previously been shared between [Teo Chee Hean](/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean) and [Tharman Shanmugaratnam](/wiki/Tharman_Shanmugaratnam). He also continued to hold the Cabinet portfolio of [Minister for Finance](/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Singapore)). From 1985 to 2019, there had always been two Deputy Prime Ministers sitting concurrently in the Cabinet. The unique circumstance of Heng becoming the sole holder of the office, together with his earlier appointment as the party's first assistant secretary-general, was seen by political observers as paving him the way to becoming the next [prime minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore). On 30 June 2020, the Nomination Day for the [2020 general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election), Heng announced that he would be contesting in [East Coast GRC](/wiki/East_Coast_Group_Representation_Constituency), after [Lim Swee Say](/wiki/Lim_Swee_Say) stepped down as Member of Parliament of [East Coast GRC](/wiki/East_Coast_Group_Representation_Constituency), which had surprising political observers as he had been expected to run for election in [Tampines GRC](/wiki/Tampines_Group_Representation_Constituency), which he had been representing for two terms since 2011. When campaigning, Heng gave what *[The Economist](/wiki/The_Economist)* described as a \"disastrous speech\" to unveil the PAP's manifesto for East Coast GRC residents called \"Together We Care @East Coast\", during which \"he fumbled his lines so badly that it inspired widespread public ridicule and a bounty of internet memes\". The plan became popularly known as the \"East Coast Plan\" among Singaporeans and on social media. In the campaigning period, a police report was lodged against Heng after comments he had made during a student forum at [Nanyang Technological University](/wiki/Nanyang_Technological_University) in 2019 resurfaced. While responding to a question on the possibility of Singapore having an ethnicity from the non-Chinese community as [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore), Heng had said that the older generation was \"not ready for a prime minister from a minority race\", i.e. a non-Chinese Prime Minister. The police released a statement on 7 July 2020, stating that they had consulted the [Attorney-General's Chambers](/wiki/Attorney-General_of_Singapore) (AGC) and deemed that Heng's remarks had no intent to wound anyone's racial feelings or promote enmity between different races. On 10 July 2020, the five-member PAP team led by Heng contesting in East Coast GRC won 53.41% of the vote against the [Workers' Party](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Singapore)), and Heng was elected as the Member of Parliament representing the Bedok ward of East Coast GRC. He continued to hold his Cabinet appointments as [Deputy Prime Minister](/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) and [Minister for Finance](/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Singapore)) after the election. On 18 February 2020, Heng delivered a budget speech in [Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore) when the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Singapore) had just struck Singapore in January 2020. Referred to as the \"Unity Budget\", the government budget for 2020 covered measures to cover uncertainties long-term against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. On 26 March 2020, Heng delivered a second budget speech announcing an additional S$55 billion \"Resilience Budget\" in response to the worsening situation of the pandemic and to mitigate the economic impact on businesses. It was the second time in Singapore's history since the [2008 financial crisis](/wiki/2008_financial_crisis) that [past reserves](/wiki/Reserves_of_the_Government_of_Singapore) had to be used to fund the initiatives provided. Measures include a cash grant of S$9,000 for eligible self-employed persons as well as S$3,000 for lower-income recipients under the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme as emergency relief against the pandemic. Heng also mentioned that this would likely be the worst contraction ever in the economy since 1965. On 27 July 2020, Heng took up an additional Cabinet appointment as [Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies](/wiki/Coordinating_Minister_for_Economic_Policies). After the [2020 general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election), Heng had been widely seen as the leading contender to be the next [prime minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore). However, he withdrew himself from the nomination on 8 April 2021, citing age and health concerns, although some political analysts also attributed his withdrawal to the PAP's [marginal win](/wiki/Marginal_seat) in [East Coast GRC](/wiki/East_Coast_Group_Representation_Constituency) at the 2020 general election. ### 2021–2025 Following a [Cabinet reshuffle](/wiki/Fifth_Lee_Hsien_Loong_Cabinet) on 15 May 2021, Heng relinquished his Cabinet portfolio of [Minister for Finance](/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Singapore)), and was succeeded by [Lawrence Wong](/wiki/Lawrence_Wong). On 28 May 2021, the [Monetary Authority of Singapore](/wiki/Monetary_Authority_of_Singapore) announced that Heng had been reappointed as a member of its board for a further term of three years. Heng has spoken on the [Anti-Indian sentiment](/wiki/Anti-Indian_sentiment) of Singapore. Heng has shown strong support for startups and innovation in Singapore. He was the Guest of Honor at a major startup business competition The Lee Kuan Yew Global Business Plan Competition organised by [Singapore Management University](/wiki/Singapore_Management_University) in 2021 and 2023. In recent years, he has championed initiatives aimed at boosting deep tech innovation and nurturing AI talents. On 15 May 2024, Heng relinquished his cabinet portfolio of [Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies](/wiki/Coordinating_Minister_for_Economic_Policies), while retaining the portfolio of [Deputy Prime Minister](/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Singapore). On 23 April 2025, the Nomination Day for the [2025 general election](/wiki/2025_Singaporean_general_election), despite his appearance at the nomination center, Heng was not listed in the nomination papers for East Coast GRC nor other constituencies. Heng subsequently confirmed that he is not contesting the election in a Facebook post, and his retirement from politics upon the succession of the new cabinet of Ministers. ## Personal life Not much is known about Heng's personal life, but it was rumoured that his father was Singaporean comedian Heng Kim Ching, professionally known as [Wang Sa](/wiki/Wang_Sa). In a media interview, he debunked the rumour. Heng is married to Chang Hwee Nee, the chief executive officer of the [National Heritage Board](/wiki/National_Heritage_Board_(Singapore)). They have two children. On 12 May 2016, Heng collapsed from a [stroke](/wiki/Stroke) during a [Cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Singapore) meeting. He was taken to [Tan Tock Seng Hospital](/wiki/Tan_Tock_Seng_Hospital), where he underwent [neurosurgery](/wiki/Neurosurgery) to relieve pressure in his brain. He was transferred to the [intensive care unit](/wiki/Intensive_care_unit) after the surgery and discharged on 25 June 2016. He resumed his duties as a Member of Parliament and Minister for Finance on 22 August 2016. ## Honours - [Public Administration Medal](/wiki/Pingat_Pentadbiran_Awam) (PPA) (2001) - [Meritorious Service Medal](/wiki/Pingat_Jasa_Gemilang) (PJG) (2010) ## Notes - Heng Swee Keat on [Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore) - Heng Swee Keat on Singapore Prime Minister's Office Government officesPreceded by[Koh Yong Guan](/wiki/Koh_Yong_Guan) **Managing Director of the [Monetary Authority of Singapore](/wiki/Monetary_Authority_of_Singapore)** 2005 – 2011Succeeded byRavi MenonPolitical officesPreceded by[Ng Eng Hen](/wiki/Ng_Eng_Hen) **[Minister for Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore))** 2011–2015Succeeded by[Ng Chee Meng](/wiki/Ng_Chee_Meng)***as Minister for Education (Schools)*** Succeeded by[Ong Ye Kung](/wiki/Ong_Ye_Kung)***as Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills)*** Preceded by[Tharman Shanmugaratnam](/wiki/Tharman_Shanmugaratnam) **[Minister for Finance](/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Singapore))** 2015–2021Succeeded by[Lawrence Wong](/wiki/Lawrence_Wong)Preceded by[Teo Chee Hean](/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean) [Tharman Shanmugaratnam](/wiki/Tharman_Shanmugaratnam) **[Deputy Prime Minister](/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) Serving with: [Lawrence Wong](/wiki/Lawrence_Wong) (2022–2024) [Gan Kim Yong](/wiki/Gan_Kim_Yong) (2024–2025)** 2019–2025**Vacant**[Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore)Preceded by[Sin Boon Ann](/wiki/Sin_Boon_Ann) **[Member of Parliament](/wiki/Members_of_the_Singapore_Parliament) for [Tampines GRC](/wiki/Tampines_GRC) (Tampines Central)** 2011–2020Succeeded by[Koh Poh Koon](/wiki/Koh_Poh_Koon)Preceded by[Lim Swee Say](/wiki/Lim_Swee_Say) **[Member of Parliament](/wiki/Members_of_the_Singapore_Parliament) for [East Coast GRC](/wiki/East_Coast_GRC) (Bedok)** 2020–2025Succeeded by[Edwin Tong](/wiki/Edwin_Tong)Party political officesPreceded by[Gan Kim Yong](/wiki/Gan_Kim_Yong) **[Chairman](/wiki/Party_Chair) of the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)** 2022–2025Succeeded by[Desmond Lee](/wiki/Desmond_Lee_(Singaporean_politician))\n",
