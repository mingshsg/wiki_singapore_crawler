At the time the definition of someone who could enter the modern legal profession in Japan was \"A Male Japanese national\" who must be at least twenty years old. This was not amended until 1933. It was 1936 before women were allowed to enter the bar. So it was then that women began to take the exam for entrance to the bar. Mibuchi was one of the first three women, including [Masako Nakata](/wiki/Masako_Nakata) and [Ai Kume](/wiki/Ai_Kume), to pass the exam in 1938. The women started their studies of law from 1929 at Women's College, Meiji University. All three became fully qualified lawyers after an eighteen-month internship, in 1940. Mibuchi became one of the first two women judges in 1949 after the new constitution. She was the first woman judge in the Nagoya District Court in 1952. In 1972 Mibuchi went on to be the first woman chief judge of the [Niigata Prefecture](/wiki/Niigata_Prefecture) family court. She died on May 28, 1984. - *[The Tiger and Her Wings](/wiki/The_Tiger_and_Her_Wings)* (2024 television series). The protagonist Tomoko Inotsume is modeled after Mibuchi.
