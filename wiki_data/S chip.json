  "content": "Chinese companies listed on the Singapore Exchange **S chips** ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): S股) are Chinese companies listed on the [Singapore Exchange](/wiki/Singapore_Exchange). Their shares are known as **S shares**. S chips are incorporated in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), the [British Virgin Islands](/wiki/British_Virgin_Islands), the [Cayman Islands](/wiki/Cayman_Islands) and [Bermuda](/wiki/Bermuda)[*citation needed*] and have their business operations in mainland China. Some S chips were beset by corporate governance and accounting problems, resulting in reputational issues that led to share price declines in 2009. The main difference between S chips and [P chips](/wiki/P_chip) is the exchange on which they are traded.[*citation needed*] An index that covers the prices of S-Chips is the FTSE ST China Index. From January 2008 to October 2009, the FTSE ST China Index had a return of −60%, as opposed to a return of −20% for the [Hang Seng China Enterprises Index](/wiki/Hang_Seng_China_Enterprises_Index), which covers the prices of [H shares](/wiki/H_share). - [Chip](/wiki/Chip_(stock_market)) - [A share](/wiki/A_share_(mainland_China)) - [B share](/wiki/B_share_(mainland_China)) - [Red chip](/wiki/Red_chip) - [P chip](/wiki/P_chip) - [Blue chip](/wiki/Blue_chip_(stock_market)) - [N share](/wiki/N_share) - [L share](/wiki/L_share) - [G share](/wiki/G_share) - [China Concepts Stock](/wiki/China_Concepts_Stock) - [Green chip](/wiki/Green_chip)\n",
