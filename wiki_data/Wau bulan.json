  "content": "Malaysian moon-kite ***Wau bulan*** ([Kelantanese](/wiki/Kelantanese): *Wa bule*; [Jawi](/wiki/Jawi_script): واو بولن‎; lit. '[moon](/wiki/Lunar_phases) kite') is an intricately designed [Malaysian](/wiki/Malaysia) [kite](/wiki/Kite) (normally with floral motifs) that is traditionally flown in the [Malaysian](/wiki/Malaysia) state of [Kelantan](/wiki/Kelantan). It is one of Malaysia's national symbols, some others being the [hibiscus](/wiki/Hibiscus_rosa-sinensis). The reverse side of the fifty-cent coin of Malaysia (1989 series) features an intricately decorated *wau bulan* with a hummer on top. The logo of [Malaysia Airlines](/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines) (MAS) is based on the *wau kucing* (lit. '[cat](/wiki/Felis_catus) kite'). There are many types of wau in Malaysia, each with its own specialty. *Wau kucing* and *wau merak* ([peacock](/wiki/Peacock) kite) are some of the variants. The *wau bulan* is the subject of a popular *[dikir barat](/wiki/Dikir_barat)* song, 'Wau Bulan' ([Kelantanese](/wiki/Kelantanese): *E Wa Bule*), which is widely associated with [Kelantan](/wiki/Kelantan). ## Characteristics Wau bulan got its name from the crescent moon-like shape of its lower section (*moon* means \"bulan\" in [Malaysian Malay](/wiki/Malaysian_Malay)). Given the right colour, wau bulan apparently resembles a rising crescent moon when flown. The size of wau bulan is bigger than any other Malaysian traditional kite. The typical size is 2.5 meters in width and 3.5 meters in length. This makes the decorations painted on the kite's body to be visible when it is flown high in the air. To make it more distinctive, wau bulan is normally decorated with large, strong-coloured patterns. Some of these are ‘Sobek’, one of the more common patterns. ## Gallery\n",
