The inaugural meeting for the organisation since its formation. The event was hosted by the [government of Singapore](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore) at the [Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre](/wiki/Singapore_International_Convention_and_Exhibition_Centre) in [Suntec City](/wiki/Suntec_City). The conference established four permanent working groups, covering [transparency](/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)) in [government procurement](/wiki/Government_procurement), [trade facilitation](/wiki/Trade_facilitation) (customs issues), trade and investment, and trade and competition, and an international agreement on trade in [information technology](/wiki/Information_technology) products was signed. The purpose of the first of these groups was to conduct \"a study on transparency in government procurement practices, taking into account national policies and, based on this study, to develop elements for inclusion in an appropriate agreement\". The topics covered by these groups collectively are called the [Singapore issues](/wiki/Singapore_issues). - http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min96_e/min96_e.htm This [international trade](/wiki/International_trade) related article is a stub.
