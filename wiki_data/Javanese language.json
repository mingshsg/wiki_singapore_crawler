  "content": "Austronesian language**This article contains letters from the [Javanese script](/wiki/Javanese_script).** Without proper rendering support, you may see [question marks, boxes, or other symbols](/wiki/Specials_(Unicode_block)#Replacement_character) instead of Javanese characters. **Javanese** (/ˌdʒɑːvəˈniːz/ *JAH-və-NEEZ*, /dʒævə-/ *JAV-ə-*, /-ˈniːs/ *-⁠NEESS*; *Basa Jawa*, [Javanese script](/wiki/Aksara_Jawa): ꦧꦱꦗꦮ, [Pegon](/wiki/Pegon_script): باسا جاوا‎, IPA: [bɔsɔ d͡ʒɔwɔ]) is an [Austronesian language](/wiki/Austronesian_languages) spoken primarily by the [Javanese people](/wiki/Javanese_people) from the central and eastern parts of the island of [Java](/wiki/Java), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia). There are also pockets of Javanese speakers on the northern coast of western Java. It is the native language of more than 68 million people. Javanese is the largest of the [Austronesian languages](/wiki/Austronesian_languages) in [number of native speakers](/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers). It has several regional dialects and a number of clearly distinct status styles. Its closest relatives are the neighboring languages such as [Sundanese](/wiki/Sundanese_language), [Madurese](/wiki/Madurese_language), and [Balinese](/wiki/Balinese_language). Most speakers of Javanese also speak [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_language) for official and commercial purposes as well as a means to communicate with non-Javanese-speaking [Indonesians](/wiki/Indonesians). There are speakers of Javanese in [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) (concentrated in the West Coast part of the states of [Selangor](/wiki/Selangor) and [Johor](/wiki/Johor)) and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). Javanese is also spoken by traditional [immigrant communities of Javanese descent](/wiki/Javanese_Surinamese) in [Suriname](/wiki/Suriname), [Sri Lanka](/wiki/Sri_Lanka) and [New Caledonia](/wiki/New_Caledonia). Along with [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_language), Javanese is an [official language](/wiki/Official_language) in the [Special Region of Yogyakarta](/wiki/Special_Region_of_Yogyakarta), Indonesia. ## Geographical distribution Javanese is spoken throughout Indonesia, neighboring [Southeast Asian](/wiki/Southeast_Asia) countries, the Netherlands, [Suriname](/wiki/Suriname), [New Caledonia](/wiki/New_Caledonia), and other countries. The largest populations of speakers are found in the six provinces of Java itself, and in the neighboring Sumatran province of [Lampung](/wiki/Lampung). The language is spoken in [Yogyakarta](/wiki/Special_Region_of_Yogyakarta), [Central](/wiki/Central_Java) and [East Java](/wiki/East_Java), as well as on the north coast of [West Java](/wiki/West_Java) and [Banten](/wiki/Banten). It is also spoken elsewhere by the Javanese people in other provinces of Indonesia, who are numerous due to the government-sanctioned transmigration program in the late 20th century, including [Lampung](/wiki/Lampung), [Jambi](/wiki/Jambi), and [North Sumatra](/wiki/North_Sumatra) provinces. In Suriname, Javanese is spoken among [descendants of plantation migrants](/wiki/Javanese_Surinamese) brought by the Dutch during the 19th century. In Madura, Bali, Lombok, and the Sunda region of West Java, it is also used as a [literary language](/wiki/Literary_language). It was the court language in [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang), [South Sumatra](/wiki/South_Sumatra), until the palace was sacked by the Dutch in the late 18th century. Javanese is written with the [Latin script](/wiki/Javanese_Latin_alphabet), [Javanese script](/wiki/Javanese_script), and [Arabic script](/wiki/Pegon_alphabet). In the present day, the Latin script dominates writings, although the Javanese script is still taught as part of the compulsory Javanese language subject in elementary up to high school levels in Yogyakarta, Central and East Java. Javanese is the [twenty-second largest language by native speakers](/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers) and the seventh largest language without official status at the national level. It is spoken or understood by approximately 100 million people. At least 45% of the total population of Indonesia are of Javanese descent or live in an area where Javanese is the dominant language. All seven Indonesian presidents since 1945 have been of Javanese descent.[a] It is therefore not surprising that Javanese has had a deep influence on the development of Indonesian, the national language of [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia). There are three main dialects of the modern language: Central Javanese, Eastern Javanese, and Western Javanese. These three dialects form a [dialect continuum](/wiki/Dialect_continuum) from northern [Banten](/wiki/Banten) in the extreme west of Java to [Banyuwangi Regency](/wiki/Banyuwangi_Regency) in the eastern corner of the island. All Javanese dialects are more or less [mutually intelligible](/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility).

By this reckoning there were well over 60 million Javanese speakers, from a national population of 147,490,298.[d] In Banten, the descendants of the Central Javanese conquerors who founded the Islamic Sultanate there in the 16th century still speak an archaic form of Javanese. The rest of the population mainly speaks Sundanese and Indonesian, since this province borders directly on Jakarta.[e] At least one third of the population of [Jakarta](/wiki/Jakarta) are of Javanese descent, so they speak Javanese or have knowledge of it. In the province of [West Java](/wiki/West_Java), many people speak Javanese, especially those living in the areas bordering [Central Java](/wiki/Central_Java), the cultural homeland of the Javanese. Almost a quarter of the population of [East Java](/wiki/East_Java) province are [Madurese](/wiki/Madurese_people) (mostly on the [Isle of Madura](/wiki/Madura)); many Madurese have some knowledge of colloquial Javanese. Since the 19th century, Madurese was also written in the Javanese script.[f] The original inhabitants of [Lampung](/wiki/Lampung), the Lampungese, make up only 15% of the provincial population. The rest are the so-called \"transmigrants\", settlers from other parts of Indonesia, many as a result of past government [transmigration programs](/wiki/Transmigration_program). Most of these transmigrants are Javanese who have settled there since the 19th century. In [Suriname](/wiki/Suriname) (the former [Dutch colony of Surinam](/wiki/Surinam_(Dutch_colony))), South America, approximately 15% of the population of some 500,000 are of Javanese descent, among whom 75,000 speak Javanese. A local variant evolved: the *Tyoro Jowo-Suriname* or *Suriname Javanese*. ## Classification Javanese is part of the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family, although its precise relationship to other Malayo-Polynesian languages is hard to determine. Using the [lexicostatistical](/wiki/Lexicostatistical) method, [Isidore Dyen](/wiki/Isidore_Dyen) classified Javanese as part of the \"Javo-Sumatra Hesion\", which also includes the [Sundanese](/wiki/Sundanese_language) and \"Malayic\" languages.[g] This grouping is also called \"Malayo-Javanic\" by linguist Berndt Nothofer, who was the first to attempt a reconstruction of it based on only four languages with the best attestation at the time (Javanese, Sundanese, [Madurese](/wiki/Madurese_language), and [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language)). Malayo-Javanic has been criticized and rejected by various linguists. [Alexander Adelaar](/wiki/Alexander_Adelaar) does not include Javanese in his proposed [Malayo-Sumbawan](/wiki/Malayo-Sumbawan_languages) grouping (which also covers [Malayic](/wiki/Malayic_languages), [Sundanese](/wiki/Sundanese_language), and [Madurese](/wiki/Madurese_language) languages). [Robert Blust](/wiki/Robert_Blust) also does not include Javanese in the [Greater North Borneo](/wiki/Greater_North_Borneo_languages) subgroup, which he proposes as an alternative to Malayo-Sumbawan grouping. However, Blust also expresses the possibility that Greater North Borneo languages are closely related to many other western Indonesian languages, including Javanese. Blust's suggestion has been further elaborated by Alexander Smith, who includes Javanese in the [Western Indonesian](/wiki/Western_Indonesian_languages) grouping (which also includes GNB and several other subgroups), which Smith considers as one of Malayo-Polynesian's primary branches. ## Dialects There are three main groups of Javanese [dialects](/wiki/Dialect), based on sub-regions: Western Javanese, Central Javanese, and Eastern Javanese. The differences are primarily in pronunciation, but with vocabulary differences also. Not all Javanese dialects are mutually intelligible; for example, a Javanese speaker from Surabaya might not be able to understand the Javanese spoken in Tegal, or the formal registers spoken in parts of Central Java. A preliminary general classification of Javanese dialects given by the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Evolutionary_Anthropology)'s Department of Linguistics is as follows. Pesisir (Tegalan), Banyumas and Tengger are considered to be among the most conservative dialects. The [Banten](/wiki/Banten), Pesisir Lor, [Banyumas](/wiki/Banyumas_Regency) and [Tengger dialect](/wiki/Tenggerese_dialect) do not have the vowel raising and vowel harmony features that are innovations of the \"standard\" Solo and Yogyakarta dialects. - **West Java (Geographically) :** - [Banten](/wiki/Banten) - [Cirebon](/wiki/Cirebon) - **Central Java (Geographically)** : - Pesisir Lor dialects - [Tegal](/wiki/Tegal_Regency) - [Pemalang](/wiki/Pemalang_Regency) - [Pekalongan](/wiki/Pekalongan) - [Yogyakarta](/wiki/Yogyakarta) - [Surakarta](/wiki/Surakarta)/Solo - [Semarang](/wiki/Semarang) - [Banyumas](/wiki/Banyumas_Regency) - [Cilacap](/wiki/Cilacap_Regency) - [Purwokerto](/wiki/Purwokerto) - [Kebumen](/wiki/Kebumen_Regency) - **East Java (Geographically)** - [Surabaya](/wiki/Surabaya) - [Malang](/wiki/Malang) - [Madiun](/wiki/Madiun)-[Kediri](/wiki/Kediri_Regency)-[Blitar](/wiki/Blitar_Regency) - [Lumajang](/wiki/Lumajang_Regency) - [Osing](/wiki/Osing_language) - [Tengger](/wiki/Tenggerese_dialect) ### Dialects description #### Standard Javanese Standard Javanese is the variety of the Javanese language that was developed at the [Yogyakarta](/wiki/Yogyakarta_Sultanate) and [Surakarta](/wiki/Surakarta_Sunanate) courts (the heirs to the Mataram Sultanate that once dominated the whole of Java and beyond), based on the Central Javanese dialect, and becomes the basis for the Javanese modern writings. It is marked with the strict usage of two speech levels for politeness, i.e. [vernacular](/wiki/Vernacular) level called *ngoko* and high-register level called *krama*. Other dialects do not contrast the usage of the speech levels. #### Central Javanese Central Javanese (*Jawa Tengahan*) is founded on the speech of [Surakarta](/wiki/Surakarta)[h] and to a lesser extent of [Yogyakarta](/wiki/Yogyakarta). It is considered the most \"refined\" of the regional variants, and serves as a model for the standard language. This variant is used throughout eastern part of [Central Java](/wiki/Central_Java), the [Special Region of Yogyakarta](/wiki/Special_Region_of_Yogyakarta), and the western and southern part of [East Java](/wiki/East_Java) provinces. There are many lower-level dialects such as *Kedu* (influenced by [Banyumasan](/wiki/Banyumasan_dialect)), *Muria* and *Semarangan*, as well as *Surakarta* and *Yogyakarta* themselves. Javanese spoken in the Western and Southern Part of [East Java](/wiki/East_Java) ([Madiun](/wiki/Madiun_Regency), [Ponorogo](/wiki/Ponorogo_Regency), [Ngawi](/wiki/Ngawi_Regency), [Magetan](/wiki/Magetan_Regency), [Pacitan](/wiki/Pacitan_Regency), [Tulungagung](/wiki/Tulungagung_Regency), [Trenggalek](/wiki/Trenggalek_Regency) and most parts of [Kediri](/wiki/Kediri_Regency), [Nganjuk](/wiki/Nganjuk_Regency) and [Blitar](/wiki/Blitar_Regency)) bears a strong influence of Surakarta Javanese. This variant is also used by Mataraman descendant's outside the Mataraman cultural area, like small part of western region of [Jombang Regency](/wiki/Jombang_Regency), small part of western region of [Malang Regency](/wiki/Malang_Regency), almost of southern part of [Banyuwangi Regency](/wiki/Banyuwangi_Regency) (pesanggaran until tegaldlimo district) and south and southeastern part of [Jember Regency](/wiki/Jember_Regency) (Wuluhan until Tempurejo district). The variation of Central Javanese are said to be so plentiful that almost every administrative region (or *[kabupatèn](/wiki/Regency_(Indonesia))*) has its own local slang. There some influences of other dialect, like in the eastern part of [Nganjuk](/wiki/Nganjuk_Regency) (greater Kertosono), north and northeastern part of [Kediri](/wiki/Kediri_Regency) (ex kawedanan Papar & ex kawedanan Pare) and the eastern part of [Blitar](/wiki/Blitar_Regency) (ex kawedanan Wlingi) there is some influences of the Arekan dialect, even though the basic vocabulary is still predominantly Mataraman and still classified as Mataraman Dialect. 1. **Mataram dialect**, **[Kewu](/wiki/Kewu_Plain) dialect**, or **Standard dialect** is spoken commonly in [Yogyakarta](/wiki/Special_Region_of_Yogyakarta), [Surakarta](/wiki/Surakarta), [Klaten](/wiki/Klaten_Regency), [Karanganyar](/wiki/Karanganyar_Regency), [Wonogiri](/wiki/Wonogiri_Regency), [Sukoharjo](/wiki/Sukoharjo_Regency), [Sragen](/wiki/Sragen_Regency), [Boyolali](/wiki/Boyolali_Regency), and eastern half of [Magelang Regency](/wiki/Magelang_Regency). 2. **Pekalongan dialect** is spoken in [Pekalongan](/wiki/Pekalongan), [Pekalongan regency](/wiki/Pekalongan_Regency), [Batang](/wiki/Batang_Regency) and also in [Pemalang](/wiki/Pemalang_Regency). 3. **Kedu dialect** is spoken in the former [Kedu residency](/wiki/Kedu_Residency), including: [Temanggung](/wiki/Temanggung_Regency), eastern part of [Kebumen](/wiki/Kebumen_Regency), [Magelang](/wiki/Magelang_Regency), and [Wonosobo](/wiki/Wonosobo_Regency). 1. **Bagelen dialect** is sub-dialect of Kedu spoken in [Purworejo](/wiki/Purworejo_Regency). 4. **Semarang dialect** is spoken in [Semarang](/wiki/Semarang), [Semarang regency](/wiki/Semarang_Regency), and also [Salatiga](/wiki/Salatiga), [Grobogan](/wiki/Grobogan_Regency), [Demak](/wiki/Demak_Regency) and [Kendal](/wiki/Kendal_Regency). 5. **Muria (Agung) dialect** or **Eastern North-Coast dialect** is spoken in [Jepara](/wiki/Jepara_Regency), [Rembang](/wiki/Rembang_Regency), [Kudus](/wiki/Kudus_Regency), [Pati](/wiki/Pati_Regency), and also in [Tuban](/wiki/Tuban_Regency) and [Bojonegoro](/wiki/Bojonegoro_Regency). 1. **Blora dialect** is sub-dialect of Muria, spoken in [Blora](/wiki/Blora_Regency), the eastern part of [Grobogan](/wiki/Grobogan_Regency), and the western part of [Ngawi](/wiki/Ngawi_Regency). 6. **Madiunan dialect** or **Mataraman dialect** is spoken mainly in western part of [East Java](/wiki/East_Java) province, including [Madiun](/wiki/Madiun), [Ngawi](/wiki/Ngawi_Regency), [Pacitan](/wiki/Pacitan_Regency), [Ponorogo](/wiki/Ponorogo_Regency), [Magetan](/wiki/Magetan_Regency), [Kediri](/wiki/Kediri_(city)), [Nganjuk](/wiki/Nganjuk_Regency), [Trenggalek](/wiki/Trenggalek_Regency), [Tulungagung](/wiki/Tulungagung_Regency), and [Blitar](/wiki/Blitar). #### Western Javanese Western Javanese (*Jawa Kulonan*), spoken in the western part of the [Central Java](/wiki/Central_Java) province and throughout the [West Java](/wiki/West_Java) and [Banten](/wiki/Banten) province (particularly on the north coast), includes dialects that are distinct for their [Sundanese](/wiki/Sundanese_language) influences. It retains many archaic words and original pronunciation from Old Javanese. 1. **North [Banten](/wiki/Banten) dialect** (*Jawa Sérang*) is spoken in [Serang](/wiki/Serang_Regency), [Cilegon](/wiki/Cilegon), and the western part of [Tangerang regency](/wiki/Tangerang_Regency). 2. **Cirebon dialect** (*Cirebonan* or *basa Cerbon*) is spoken in [Cirebon](/wiki/Cirebon_Regency), [Indramayu](/wiki/Indramayu_Regency), and [Losari](/wiki/Losari,_Brebes). 3. **Tegal dialect**, known as *Tegalan* or *dhialèk Pantura* (North-Coast dialect), is spoken in [Tegal](/wiki/Tegal_Regency), [Brebes](/wiki/Brebes_Regency), and the western part of [Pemalang](/wiki/Pemalang_Regency) regency. 4. **Banyumas dialect**, known as *[Banyumasan](/wiki/Banyumasan_dialect)*, is spoken in [Banyumas](/wiki/Banyumas_Regency), [Cilacap](/wiki/Cilacap_Regency), [Purbalingga](/wiki/Purbalingga_Regency), [Banjarnegara](/wiki/Banjarnegara_Regency), and [Bumiayu](/wiki/Bumiayu,_Brebes). Some Western Javanese dialects such as Banyumasan dialects and Tegal dialect are sometimes referred to as *basa ngapak* by other Javanese because of the dialectal pronunciation of word *apa* (what). #### Eastern Javanese Eastern Javanese (*Jawa Wétanan*) speakers range from the eastern banks of [Brantas River](/wiki/Brantas_River) in Kertosono, and from [Jombang](/wiki/Jombang_Regency) to [Banyuwangi](/wiki/Banyuwangi_Regency), comprising the second majority of the [East Java](/wiki/East_Java) province excluding [Madura](/wiki/Madura) island, [Situbondo](/wiki/Situbondo_Regency) and [Bondowoso](/wiki/Bondowoso_Regency). However, some variant like Pedalungan has been influenced by [Madurese](/wiki/Madurese_language). The most outlying Eastern Javanese dialect is spoken in Balambangan (or [Banyuwangi](/wiki/Banyuwangi_Regency)). It is generally known as *[basa Using](/wiki/Osing_language)*. *Using*, a local negation word, is a cognate of *tusing* in [Balinese](/wiki/Balinese_language). 1. **Arekan dialect** is commonly spoken in [Surabaya](/wiki/Surabaya), [Malang](/wiki/Malang_Regency), [Gresik](/wiki/Gresik_Regency), [Mojokerto](/wiki/Mojokerto_Regency), [Pasuruan](/wiki/Pasuruan_Regency), [Lumajang](/wiki/Lumajang_Regency), western and south-western part of [Jember](/wiki/Jember_Regency), eastern part of [Lamongan](/wiki/Lamongan_Regency), and [Sidoarjo](/wiki/Sidoarjo_Regency). Many [Madurese people](/wiki/Madurese_people) also use this dialect as their second language. 1. **Pasisir Lor Wétan (Northeastern Coast) or Surabaya dialect** is spoken in Surabaya, Sidoarjo, southern part of Gresik, Mojokerto and most part of Lamongan. 2. **Malang-Pasuruhan dialect** is spoken in [Malang](/wiki/Malang_Regency) and [Pasuruan](/wiki/Pasuruan_Regency). 3. **Lumajangan dialect** is sub-dialect of arekan, bit influenced by madurese languages, spoken in west and southern part of [Lumajang](/wiki/Lumajang_Regency) (except in north and north-east which base of madurese people's) and also spoken in southwestern part of [Jember](/wiki/Jember_Regency) like Kencong, Jombang, Umbulsari, Gumukmas and southern part of Sumberbaru. 4. **Jombang dialect** is sub dialect of Arekan, bit influenced by Mataraman Javanese dialect, spoken in most part of Jombang 5. **Gresik dialect or Giri dialect** is the outermost in the Arekan dialect group spoken in the northern and central regions of Gresik Regency. Gresik Javanese is thought to be a blend of Arekan Javanese (especially the Surabaya dialect) with Javanese from the Kesunanan Giri era. 2. **[Tengger dialect](/wiki/Tenggerese_dialect)** used by [Tengger people](/wiki/Tenggerese_people), which is centered in thirty villages in the isolated Tengger mountains ([Mount Bromo](/wiki/Mount_Bromo)) within the [Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park](/wiki/Bromo_Tengger_Semeru_National_Park) in East-Central [Java](/wiki/Java). 3. **[Osing dialect](/wiki/Osing_language)** or Blambangan dialect is spoken in central part of [Banyuwangi](/wiki/Banyuwangi_Regency). #### Surinamese-Javanese Surinamese-Javanese is mainly based on Central Javanese, especially from [Kedu Residency](/wiki/Kedu_Residency). The number of speakers of Suriname-Javanese in Suriname was estimated at 60,000 as of 2012. Most Surinamese-Javanese are bi- or trilingual. According to the 2004 census, Surinamese-Javanese was the first or second language in 11 percent of households. In a 2012 study of multilingualism in Surinamese education by the Dutch Language Union, 3,497 out of 22,643 pupils (15 percent) in primary education indicated Surinamese-Javanese as a language spoken at home. Most of them were living in [Wanica](/wiki/Wanica_District) and [Paramaribo](/wiki/Paramaribo_District) districts. Not all immigrants from Indonesia to Suriname were speakers of Javanese. Immigration records show that 90 percent of immigrants were Javanese, with 5 percent Sundanese, 0.5 percent Madurese and 2.5 percent from Batavia. The ethnic composition of this last group was not determinable. Probably Sundanese, Madurese or Malay speaking immigrants were forced to learn Javanese during their stay in Suriname to adapt. In view of the language policies in Netherlands Indies at the time of immigration, it is unlikely the immigrants had knowledge of the Dutch language prior to immigration to Suriname. Dutch today is the official language of Suriname. Surinamese Javanese is somewhat different from Indonesian Javanese. In Surinamese-Javanese there is a difference between formal and informal speech. Surinamese-Javanese took many loanwords from languages like Dutch, [Sranantongo](/wiki/Sranan_Tongo), [Sarnami](/wiki/Sarnami_Hindustani) and Indonesian. The influence of the latter language, which is not spoken in Suriname, can be attributed to the Indonesian embassy and Islamic teachers from Indonesia. Indonesian movies are popular, and usually shown without subtitles on Surinamese-Javanese television channels. Loanwords of Sranantongo and Dutch in Surinamese-Javanese Surinamese-JavaneseSranantongoDutchEnglishngabrahabraoveracrossbabrikfabriekfactorybakrahbakrablankewhite manblangkemanblakamanzwarte manblack manbedibedibedbedbusibusibosjunglepernangsipernasiplantageplantationsekautskowtuschout (politieagent)policeman In 1986, the Surinamese government adopted an official spelling for Surinamese-Javanese. It is seldom used as a written language, however. In the 2012 survey, pupils who indicated Surinamese-Javanese as a language spoken at home, reported Dutch (97.9 percent) and Sranantongo (76.9 percent) also being spoken in the household. Surinamese-Javanese speaking pupils report high proficiency in speaking and understanding, but very low literacy in the language. They report a low preference for the language in interaction with family members, including their parents, with the exception of their grandparents. Pupils where Surinamese-Javanese is spoken at home tend to speak Dutch (77 percent) rather than Surinamese-Javanese (12 percent). #### New Caledonian Javanese As expected, New Caledonian Javanese is somewhat different from Indonesian Javanese. New Caledonian Javanese took many loanwords from French. New Caledonian society, in addition to their mastery of the language according to their ethnicity ([Javanese New Caledonians](/wiki/Javanese_New_Caledonians)), is obliged to be fluent in French that is a medium that is used in all the affairs of the state, economy, and education. French is regarded as a prestigious language because it is the language of the government, an official language in France include New Caledonia, one of the major languages in Europe, and one of the official languages of the United Nations. ### Phonetic differences Phoneme /i/ at closed [ultima](/wiki/Ultima_(linguistics)) is pronounced as [ɪ] in Central Javanese (Surakarta–Yogyakarta dialect), as [i] in Western Javanese ([Banyumasan](/wiki/Banyumasan_dialect) dialect), and as [ɛ] in Eastern Javanese. Phoneme /u/ at closed ultima is pronounced as [ʊ] in Central Javanese, as [u] in Western Javanese, and as [ɔ] in Eastern Javanese. Phoneme /a/ at closed ultima in Central Javanese is pronounced as [a] and at open ultima as [ɔ]. Regardless of position, it tends toward [a] in Western Javanese and as [ɔ] in Eastern Javanese. Western Javanese tends to add a glottal stop at the end of word-final vowels, e.g.: *Ana apa?* [anaʔ apaʔ] \"What happened?\", *Aja kaya kuwè!* [adʒaʔ kajaʔ kuwɛʔ] \"Don't be like that!\". Dialectal Phonetics PhonemeOrthographyCentral Javanese (standard)Western JavaneseEastern JavaneseEnglish/i/getih[g̊ət̪ɪh][g̊ət̪ih][g̊ət̪ɛh]*blood*/u/abuh[ab̥ʊh][ab̥uh][ab̥ɔh]*swollen*/a/lenga[ləŋɔ][ləŋa][ləŋɔ]*oil*/a/kancamu/kancané kowé[kaɲtʃamu][kaɲtʃanɛ kowɛ][kɔɲtʃɔmu]*your friend* Final consonant devoicing occurs in the standard Central Javanese dialect, but not in Banyumasan. For example, *endhog* (egg) is pronounced [əɳɖ̥ɔk] in standard Central Javanese, but [əɳɖ̥ɔg] in Banyumasan. The latter is closer to [Old Javanese](/wiki/Old_Javanese). ### Vocabulary differences The vocabulary of standard Javanese is enriched by dialectal words. For example, to get the meaning of \"you\", Western Javanese speakers say *rika* /rikaʔ/, Eastern Javanese use *kon* /kɔn/ or *koen* /kɔən/, and Central Javanese speakers say *kowé* /kowe/. Another example is the expression of \"how\": the Tegal dialect of Western Javanese uses *keprimèn* /kəprimen/, the [Banyumasan](/wiki/Banyumasan_dialect) dialect of Western Javanese employs *kepriwé* /kəpriwe/ or *kepribèn* /kəpriben/, Eastern Javanese speakers say *ya' apa* /jɔʔ ɔpɔ/ – originally meaning \"like what\" (*kaya apa* in standard Javanese) or *kepiyé* /kəpije/ – and Central Javanese speakers say *piye* /pije/ or *kepriyé* /kəprije/.

Between the 8th and the 15th century, this form of Javanese flourished in the island of Java. Old Javanese is commonly written in the form of verses. This language variety is also called *kawi* or 'of poets, poetical's, although this term could also be used to refer to the archaic elements of New Javanese literature. The writing system used to write Old Javanese is a descendant of the [Pallava script](/wiki/Pallava_script) from India. Almost half of the entire vocabularies found in Old Javanese literature are [Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit_language) loanwords, although Old Javanese also borrowed terms from other languages in the [Maritime Southeast Asia](/wiki/Maritime_Southeast_Asia). The form of Old Javanese found in several texts from 14th century onward (mostly written in Bali) is sometimes referred to as \"Middle Javanese\". Both Old and Middle Javanese written forms have not been widely used in Java since early 16th century. However, Old Javanese works and poetic tradition continue to be preserved in the Javanese-influenced Bali, and the variety is also used for religious purposes. ### Modern Javanese Modern Javanese emerged as the main literary form of the language in the 16th century. The change in the literary system happened as Islam started to gain influence in Java. In its early form, Modern Javanese literary form was based on the variety spoken in the [north coast of Java](/wiki/Pasisir), where Islam had already gained foothold among the local people. Many of the written works in this variety were Islamic in nature, and several of them were translation from works in Malay. The [Arabic abjad](/wiki/Arabic_abjad) was also adopted (as [Pegon](/wiki/Pegon_script)) to write Javanese. The rise of [Mataram](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Mataram) in the 17th century shifted the main literary form of Javanese to be based on the inland variety. This written tradition was preserved by writers of [Surakarta](/wiki/Surakarta) and [Yogyakarta](/wiki/Yogyakarta), and later became the basis of the modern written standard of the language. Another linguistic development associated with the rise of Mataram is the stratification of Javanese into speech levels such as *ngoko* and *krama*, which were unknown in Old Javanese. Books in Javanese have been printed since 1830s, at first using the [Javanese script](/wiki/Javanese_script), although the [Latin alphabet](/wiki/Latin_alphabet) started to be used later. Since mid-19th century, Javanese has been used in newspapers and travelogues, and later, also novels, short stories, as well as free verses. Today, it is used in media, ranging from books to TV programs, and the language is also taught at schools in primarily Javanese areas. Although Javanese is not a [national language](/wiki/National_language), it has recognized status as a [regional language](/wiki/Regional_language) in the three Indonesian provinces with the biggest concentrations of Javanese people: [Central Java](/wiki/Central_Java), Yogyakarta, and [East Java](/wiki/East_Java).[*citation needed*] Javanese is designated as the official language of the [Special Region of Yogyakarta](/wiki/Special_Region_of_Yogyakarta) under Yogyakarta Special Region Regulation Number 2 of 2021. Previously, Central Java promulgated a similar regulation—Regional Regulation 9/2012—but this did not imply an official status for the language. Javanese is taught at schools and is used in some [mass media](/wiki/Mass_media), both electronically and in print. There is, however, no longer a daily newspaper in Javanese. Javanese-language magazines include *[Panjebar Semangat](/wiki/Panjebar_Semangat)*, *Jaka Lodhang*, *Jaya Baya*, *Damar Jati*, and *Mekar Sari*. *Damar Jati*, a new Javanese language magazine, appeared in 2005 is not published in the Javanese heartlands, but in Jakarta. Since 2003, an East Java local television station ([JTV](/wiki/JTV_(Indonesia))) has broadcast some of its programmes in the Surabayan (*Suroboyoan*) dialect, including *Pojok Kampung [id]* (\"Village Corner\", main newscast), *Kuis RT/RW* (\"RT/RW Quiz\"), and *Pojok Perkoro* (\"Case Corner\", a crime newscast). In later broadcasts, JTV offers programmes in the Central Javanese dialect (called by them *basa kulonan*, \"the western language\") and Madurese. The speakers of Suroboyoan dialect are well known for being proud of their distinctive dialect and consistently maintain it wherever they go. ## Endangerment Several linguists has voiced concerns about the status of Javanese. It is believed that Ngoko Javanese enjoys a stable diglossic status, while Krama Javanese is under more serious threat. The number of Javanese native speakers has significantly dwindled over the years. In a research in Yogyakarta, it was revealed that a significant number of parents do not transmit Javanese to their children. Instead, Javanese speakers typically acquire Javanese through extrafamilial sources, like friend groups. Although Javanese enjoys a large quantity of speaker base, it is not immune from pressures from other languages like Indonesian and English. ## Phonology The Javanese language has 23–25 consonant phonemes and 6–8 vowel phonemes. The dialects of Javanese each have their own distinct characteristics in terms of phonology. The phonemes of Modern Standard Javanese as shown below. ### Vowels There is disagreement regarding the number of vowel phonemes in Javanese. According to the Javanese linguist [E. M. Uhlenbeck](/wiki/Eugenius_Uhlenbeck), Javanese has six vowel phonemes, each of which has two pronunciation variants (allophones), except for the schwa /ə/. This view is supported by several other Javanese linguists. However, an alternative analysis by some linguists concludes that Javanese has two additional phonemes, namely /ɛ/ and /ɔ/, which are considered independent phonemes, separate from /e/ and /o/. [Front](/wiki/Front_vowel)[Central](/wiki/Central_vowel)[Back](/wiki/Back_vowel)[Close](/wiki/Close_vowel)[i](/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel)[u](/wiki/Close_back_rounded_vowel)[Close-mid](/wiki/Close-mid_vowel)[e](/wiki/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel)[ə](/wiki/Mid_central_vowel)[o](/wiki/Close-mid_back_rounded_vowel)[Open-mid](/wiki/Open-mid_vowel)([ɛ](/wiki/Open-mid_front_unrounded_vowel))([ɔ](/wiki/Open-mid_back_rounded_vowel))[Open](/wiki/Open_vowel)[a](/wiki/Open_front_unrounded_vowel) Following the six-vowel analysis, the phonemes above have the following allophones: - The phoneme **/i/** has two allophones: [i], which generally appears in open syllables, and [ɪ], in closed syllables. - *mari* [mari] ‘to recover’ - *wit* [wɪt] ‘seedling’ - The phoneme **/u/** has two allophones: [u], which generally appears in open syllables, and [ʊ], in closed syllables. - *kuru* [kuru] ‘thin’ - *mung* [mʊŋ] ‘only’ - The phoneme **/e/** has two allophones: [e] and [ɛ], which can appear in both open and closed syllables. In open syllables, /e/ is realized as [ɛ] if that syllable is followed by (1) an open syllable with the vowel [i] or [u], (2) a syllable with an identical vowel, or (3) a syllable containing the vowel [ə]. - *saté* [sate] ‘satay’ - *mèri* [mɛri] ‘jealous’ - *kalèn* [kalɛn] ‘drain, gutter’ - The phoneme **/o/** has two allophones: [o], which generally appears in open syllables, and [ɔ], which can appear in both open and closed syllables. In open syllables, /o/ is realized as [ɔ] if that syllable is followed by (1) an open syllable with the vowel [i] or [u], (2) a syllable with an identical vowel, or (3) a syllable containing the vowel [ə]. - *loro* [loro] ‘two’ - *kori* [kɔri] ‘gate’ - *sorot* [sorɔt] ‘ray, light’ - The phoneme **/a/** has two allophones: [a], which generally appears in [penultimate](/wiki/Penult) (second-to-last) and antepenultimate (third-to-last) syllables, whether open or closed; and [ɔ], which can appear in open syllables. In open syllables, /a/ is only realized as [ɔ] if the syllable occurs at the end of a word, or if it is the penultimate syllable of a word ending in /a/. - *bali* [bʰali] ‘to go home’ - *kaloka* [kalokɔ] ‘famous’ - *kaya* [kɔyɔ] ‘like, as if’ - The phoneme **/ə/** is always pronounced as [ə]. - *metu* [mətu] ‘to go out’ - *pelem* [pələm] ‘mango’ In [closed syllables](/wiki/Closed_syllable) the vowels /i u e o/ are pronounced [ɪ ʊ ɛ ɔ] respectively. In open syllables, /e o/ are also [ɛ ɔ] when the following vowel is /i u/ in an open syllable; otherwise they are /ə/, or identical (/e...e/, /o...o/). In the standard dialect of Surakarta, /a/ is pronounced [ɔ] in word-final open syllables, and in any open penultimate syllable before such an [ɔ]. Example: *Janaka* = /dʒ̊anɔkɔ/ and *Nakula* = /nakulɔ/. ### Consonants [Labial](/wiki/Labial_consonant)[Dental](/wiki/Dental_consonant)/ [Alveolar](/wiki/Alveolar_consonant)[Retroflex](/wiki/Retroflex_consonant)[Palatal](/wiki/Palatal_consonant)[Velar](/wiki/Velar_consonant)[Glottal](/wiki/Glottal_consonant)[Nasal](/wiki/Nasal_consonant)[m](/wiki/Voiced_bilabial_nasal)[n](/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_nasal)[ɲ](/wiki/Voiced_palatal_nasal)[ŋ](/wiki/Voiced_velar_nasal)[Plosive](/wiki/Plosive)/ [Affricate](/wiki/Affricate)[stiff voice](/wiki/Stiff_voice)[p](/wiki/Voiceless_bilabial_plosive)[t̪](/wiki/Voiceless_dental_plosive)[ʈ](/wiki/Voiceless_retroflex_plosive)[tʃ](/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_affricate)[k](/wiki/Voiceless_velar_plosive)[ʔ](/wiki/Glottal_stop)[slack voice](/wiki/Slack_voice)[b̥](/wiki/Voiceless)[d̪̥](/wiki/Dental_consonant)[ɖ̥](/wiki/Voiceless)[dʒ̊](/wiki/Voiceless)[ɡ̊](/wiki/Voiceless)[Fricative](/wiki/Fricative)[s](/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_fricative)[h](/wiki/Voiceless_glottal_fricative)[Semivowel](/wiki/Semivowel)[j](/wiki/Voiced_palatal_approximant)[w](/wiki/Voiced_labial%E2%80%93velar_approximant)[Liquid](/wiki/Liquid_consonant)[lateral](/wiki/Lateral_consonant#Approximants)[l](/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_lateral_approximant)[rhotic](/wiki/Rhotic_consonant)[r](/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_trill) The Javanese \"voiced\" phonemes are not in fact [voiced](/wiki/Voice_(phonetics)) but voiceless, with [breathy voice](/wiki/Breathy_voice) on the following vowel. The relevant distinction in [phonation](/wiki/Phonation) of the plosives is described as [stiff voice](/wiki/Stiff_voice) versus [slack voice](/wiki/Slack_voice). A Javanese syllable can have the following [form](/wiki/Syllable#Structure): CSVC, where C = [consonant](/wiki/Consonant), S = [sonorant](/wiki/Sonorant) (/j/, /r/, /l/, /w/, or any [nasal consonant](/wiki/Nasal_stop)), and V = [vowel](/wiki/Vowel). As with other Austronesian languages, native Javanese roots consist of two syllables; words consisting of more than three syllables are broken up into groups of disyllabic words for pronunciation. In Modern Javanese, a disyllabic root is of the following type: nCsvVnCsvVC. Apart from [Madurese](/wiki/Madurese_language), Javanese is the only language of Western Indonesia to possess a distinction between [dental](/wiki/Dental_consonant) and [retroflex](/wiki/Retroflex) phonemes. The latter sounds are transcribed as \"th\" and \"dh\" in the modern Roman script, but previously by the use of an [underdot](/wiki/Dot_(diacritic)): \"ṭ\" and \"ḍ\". ### Phonotactics The most common syllable structures in Javanese are V, CV, VC, and CVC. Syllables may also begin with consonant clusters, which are generally divided into three types: 1) homorganic consonant clusters consisting of a nasal sound plus a voiced stop (NCV, NCVC), 2) consonant clusters consisting of a stop plus a liquid or semivowel (CCV, CCVC), and 3) homorganic nasal consonant clusters followed by a liquid and semivowel (NCCV, NCCVC). V: *ka-**é*** 'that'CV: ***gu**-**la*** 'sugar'VC: *pa-**it*** 'bitter'CVC: *ku-**lon*** 'west'CCV (including NCV): ***bla**-bag* 'board', ***kre**-teg* 'bridge'CCVC (including NCVC): ***prap**-ta* 'arrive'NCCVC: ***ngglam**-byar* 'unfocused' Consonant clusters between vowels generally consist of a nasal + homorganic stop (such as [mp], [mb], [ɲtʃ], and so on), or [ŋs]. The sounds /l/, /r/, and /j/ can also be added at the end of such consonant clusters. Examples of such consonant clusters are *wo**nt**en* ‘exist’, *ba**ngs**a* ‘nation’, and *sa**ntr**i* ‘santri, devout Muslim’. In Javanese, the syllable before such consonant clusters is conventionally considered an open syllable, because the sound /a/ in such a syllable undergoes rounding into [ɔ]. The word *tampa* ‘accept’, for instance, is pronounced [tɔmpɔ]. Compare this with the word *tanpa* ‘without’, which is pronounced [tanpɔ]. Most morphemes (85%) in Javanese consist of two syllables; the remaining morphemes have one, three, or four syllables. Javanese speakers have a strong tendency to change monosyllabic morphemes into disyllabic morphemes. Morphemes with four syllables are sometimes also analyzed as combinations of two morphemes each with two syllables. ### Stress Views on [stress](/wiki/Stress_(phonology)) in Javanese differ. Some linguists have claimed that there is (weak) stress on the penultimate syllable of a word, unless that syllable contains a schwa; if it does, the stress is on the final syllable. Another opinion that appears in the literature is that Javanese stress is word-final. In any case, Javanese stress is considered not to be contrastive. ## Writing system This section **does not cite any sources**. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(February 2024)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* Javanese has been traditionally written with [Javanese script](/wiki/Javanese_script). Javanese and the related [Balinese script](/wiki/Balinese_script) are modern variants of the old [Kawi script](/wiki/Kawi_script), a [Brahmic script](/wiki/Brahmic_script) introduced to Java along with Hinduism and Buddhism. Kawi is first attested in a legal document from 804 AD. It was widely used in literature and translations from Sanskrit from the 10th century; by the 17th, the script is identified as *carakan*. The Javanese script is an [abugida](/wiki/Abugida). Each of the twenty letters represents a syllable with a consonant (or a \"zero consonant\") and the inherent vowel 'a' that is pronounced as /ɔ/ in open position. Various diacritics placed around the letter indicate a different vowel than [ɔ], a final consonant, or a foreign pronunciation. Letters have subscript forms used to transcribe consonant clusters, though the shapes are relatively straightforward, and not as distinct as conjunct forms of [Devanagari](/wiki/Devanagari). Some letters are only present in [old Javanese](/wiki/Old_Javanese) and became obsolete in modern Javanese. Some of these letters became \"capital\" forms used in proper names. Punctuation includes a comma; period; a mark that covers the colon, quotations, and indicates numerals; and marks to introduce a chapter, poem, song, or letter. However, Javanese can also be written with the [Arabic script](/wiki/Arabic_script) (known as the [Pegon script](/wiki/Pegon_script)) and today generally uses [Latin script](/wiki/Javanese_Latin_alphabet) instead of Javanese script for practical purposes. A Latin [orthography](/wiki/Orthography) based on Dutch was introduced in 1926, revised in 1972–1973; it has largely supplanted the carakan.

You can help by expanding it. *(September 2022)* Javanese, like many other Austronesian languages, is an [agglutinative](/wiki/Agglutinative) language, where base words are modified through extensive use of [affixes](/wiki/Affix). #### Personal pronoun Javanese has no specific [personal pronoun](/wiki/Personal_pronoun) to express plural except for *kita* which was influenced by Indonesian's first person plural inclusive pronoun. Pronoun pluralization can be ignored or expressed by using phrases such as *aku kabèh* 'we', *awaké dhéwé* 'us', *dhèwèké kabèh* 'them' and so on. Personal pronoun in Javanese, especially for the second and third person, are more often replaced by certain nouns or titles. In addition to the pronoun described in the table below, Javanese still has a variety of other pronoun whose use varies depending on the dialect or level of speech.[*page needed*] Personal Pronoun[*page needed*] GlossFreestanding formPrefixSuffix*Ngoko**Madya**Krama**Krama Inggil/Andhap*1SG, 1PL.EXCL I *aku*–*kula**dalem**tak*-, *dak*--*ku*1PL.INCL*kita*–––––2SG, 2PL You *kowé**samang**sampéyan**panjenengan**ko*-, *kok*--*mu*3SG, 3PL He, She, It *dhèwèké*–*piyambakipun**panjenengané*, *panjenenganipun* *di*--*(n)é*, -*(n)ipun* Personal pronouns in Javanese, especially for the second and third persons, are more often replaced with specific nouns or titles. In addition to the pronouns listed in the table above, Javanese still has a wide variety of other pronouns whose usage varies depending on the dialect or speech level. #### Demonstrative Demonstrative **Proximal**MedialDistalneutral*iki*, *kiyi*, *kiyé**iku*, *kuwi*, *kuwé*(*ika*), *kaé*local*kéné**kono**kana*locative*mréné*, *réné**mrono*, *rono**mrana*, *rana*modal*mengkéné*, *ngéné**mengkono*, *ngono**mengkana*, *ngana*quantitative*seméné*, *méné**semono*, *mono**semana*, *mana*temporal*sepréné*–*seprana* The words *iki* and *iku* can be used both in writing and in conversation. The forms *kiyi*, *kiyé*, *kuwi*, and *kuwé* are mainly used in everyday speech. The form *ika* is only used in traditional Javanese poetry (*[tembang](/wiki/Javanese_poetry)*). The *madya* (middle-level politeness) forms of *iki/kiyi/kiyé*, *iku/kuwi/kuwé*, and *kaé* are *niki***,** *niku***,** and *nika*. These three types of demonstratives all share the same *krama* (high-level politeness) form, which is *punika* or *menika*, although in some cases the words *mekaten* or *ngaten* are also used as polite equivalents of *kaé*. #### Noun In Javanese, modifiers (attributes) of a head noun are placed after the noun. The head noun does not take affixes if it is followed by an attributive adjective or a non-passive verb (indicating purpose or function) that restricts the meaning of the noun. Possession can be expressed implicitly without affixes, or explicitly with the suffix *-(n)é* or *-(n)ipun* on the head noun. - *wit kinah* — ‘[cinchona](/wiki/Cinchona) tree’ - *sumur jero* — ‘deep well’ - *peranti nenun* — ‘weaving tools’ - *idham-idhaman kita* — ‘our ideals’ - *omahé Marsam* — ‘Marsam’s house’ The suffix *-(n)ing*, mainly used in written style, has several distinct meanings that indicate the relationship between the head noun and the attribute. - *ratuning buta* — ‘the king of the giants’ - *rerengganing griya* — ‘decoration for the house’ - *dèwining kaéndahan* — ‘goddess of beauty’ This section **needs expansion**. You can help by expanding it. *(July 2023)* #### Numeral Numerals are generally placed after the noun. - *wong siji* — ‘one person’ - *gelas pitu* — ‘seven glasses’ - *candhi sèwu* — ‘a thousand temples’ Numerals are placed before the noun if the noun refers to a unit of measure or a unit of number. In this position, numerals take a nasal linker: *-ng* if they end in a vowel, or *-ang* if they end in a non-nasal consonant. The only exception is the numeral *siji* ‘one’, which is replaced by the prefixes *sa-*, *se-*, or *s-* in this context. - *telu-ng puluh* — ‘thirty’ - *pat-ang pethi* — ‘four chests’ - *sa-genthong* — ‘one jar’ - *se-gelas* — ‘a glass (of)’ - *s-atus rupiyah* — ‘one hundred rupiah’ This section **needs expansion**. You can help by expanding it. *(July 2023)* #### Verb The paradigm of standard Javanese verbs can be summarized as follows: Verb paradigm mooddiathesisprefixsuffixneutralapplicative Iapplicative IIindicativeactive*N-**-Ø**-i**-aké*passive I*tak-/kok-/di-*passive II*ke-**-an**-Ø*imperativeactive*N-**-a**-ana**-na*passive I*Ø-**-en*propositiveactive(*aku*) *tak* *N-**-Ø**-i**-aké*passive I*tak-**-é**-ané**-né*subjunctiveactive*N-**-a**-ana**-na*passive I*tak-/kok-/di-**-en**-na* Not all verbal affixes in the paradigm described above are commonly used in everyday conversation. In addition, other Javanese dialects generally have a simpler verb paradigm, such as the [Tengger](/wiki/Tenggerese_dialect) dialect which does not use different affixes for verbs with subjunctive and imperative moods (although the standard dialect also does not distinguish between the two in the active form, both are marked with the affixes *N-* and *-a*). Transitive verbs in Javanese can be formed by attaching the nasal prefix *N-* to the root word for the active form, or pronominal prefixes such as *di-*, *tak-*, and *kok-* for the passive form. (1) Wis already **nemu** AV:find akal solution/idea aku I Wis **nemu** akal aku already AV:find solution/idea I ‘I have already found the solution.' (2) Kandha=ku speech/word=1.GEN **di-gugu** PASS:3-believe wong people akèh many Kandha=ku **di-gugu** wong akèh speech/word=1.GEN PASS:3-believe people many ‘My words are trusted by many people.’ The addition of the suffixes *-i* and *-aké* generally indicates higher valency. The suffix *-i* is usually applicative, as in *tanduri* ‘plant with (something)’ from the root *tandur* ‘to plant’. The suffix *-aké* (polite/krama form: *-aken*) can form causative verbs from transitive verbs, e.g. *lebokaké* ‘put in (into something)’ from *mlebu* ‘to enter’. When attached to an intransitive verb, the derived verb can be benefactive, e.g. *jupukaké* ‘take (for someone)’ from the root *jupuk* ‘take’. (3) Kuwi that **mangan-i** AV:eat-TR godhong leaf tèh tea Kuwi **mangan-i** godhong tèh that AV:eat-TR leaf tea ‘That [insect] eats the tea leaves.'\n",
