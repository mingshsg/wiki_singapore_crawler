  "content": "Planning Area and HDB Town in Central Region, Singapore **Bukit Merah**,[b] also known as **Redhill**, is a [planning area](/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore) and [new town](/wiki/New_towns_of_Singapore) situated in the southernmost part of the [Central Region of Singapore](/wiki/Central_Region,_Singapore). The planning area borders [Tanglin](/wiki/Tanglin) to the north, [Queenstown](/wiki/Queenstown,_Singapore) to the west, and the [Downtown Core](/wiki/Downtown_Core), [Outram](/wiki/Outram,_Singapore) and [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River) planning areas of the [Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore) to the east. It also shares a maritime boundary with the [Southern Islands](/wiki/Southern_Islands) planning area to the south. Bukit Merah is linked to [Sentosa Island](/wiki/Sentosa_Island) via Sentosa Gateway, Sentosa Broadwalk, [Sentosa Express](/wiki/Sentosa_Express), and the [Cable Car](/wiki/Singapore_Cable_Car). Bukit Merah planning area also includes two offshore islands which are linked to the mainland by road, namely [Pulau Brani](/wiki/Pulau_Brani) and [Keppel Island](/wiki/Keppel_Island,_Singapore). It is the most populous planning area in the Central Region and the 12th most populous in the country, with more than 150,000 residents. ## Etymology *Bukit Merah* translates to “[red](/wiki/Red) [hill](/wiki/Hill)” in [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language), and is a reference to the red-coloured [lateritic](/wiki/Laterite) soil found on the hill. According to the *[Sejarah Melayu](/wiki/Malay_Annals)*, Singapore was once plagued by [swordfish](/wiki/Swordfish) attacking people living along the coast. A young boy named [Hang Nadim](/wiki/Hang_Nadim) proposed an ingenious solution to build a wall of banana stems along the coast at the present location of [Tanjong Pagar](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar). When the swordfish attacked, their snouts were stuck in the stems. With the swordfish problem solved, Hang Nadim earned great respect from the people, but also jealousy from the rulers. The fourth King of [Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura), [Paduka Seri Maharaja](/wiki/Sri_Maharaja), finally ordered his execution, and it was said that his blood-soaked the soil of the hill where he was killed, giving rise to the red-coloured hill. The hill was eventually trimmed to its current state in 1973, when it made way for Redhill Close and what would become the now-defunct [Henderson Secondary School](/wiki/Henderson_Secondary_School). During its existence, a Chinese cemetery was situated on the reverse side of this hill, which is today the location of [Tiong Bahru](/wiki/Tiong_Bahru). ## History Keppel Harbour dates back to the 14th century when an ancient Chinese traveller, [Wang Dayuan](/wiki/Wang_Dayuan) named the harbour*\"[Long-Ya-Men](/wiki/Long_Ya_Men)\" or \"Dragon Teeth Gate\"* after two rock outcrops located near Labrador Park, which resembled dragon's teeth. The two rock outcrops were subsequently blown up by the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements) Surveyor, John Thomson, in August 1848 to widen the entrance to a new harbour. With the earliest records of Bukit Merah's existence in the [Malay Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals), the town had a considerable role to play in the early maritime trade of the [Kingdom of Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura). Mount Faber was once known as Telok Blangah Hill. Its name was changed to Mount Faber after Captain Edward Faber cut a road to the top in 1845 to establish a signal station. The [Singapore General Hospital](/wiki/Singapore_General_Hospital) site dates back to 1882. Labrador Nature Park was used as a defence outpost in the 19th century until [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II). The town's fertile red soil was put to great effect during British colonial rule, when it was a district rich in gambier cultivation. Even before the industrialisation of [Jurong](/wiki/Jurong), Bukit Merah already had a small head start in the emerging heavy industry market in Singapore. With the first brickwork factories and mills emerging in the precincts of Henderson Hill and Redhill as early as the 1930s. The town is also home to the first housing estate in the country, [Tiong Bahru](/wiki/Tiong_Bahru), which was developed by the [Singapore Improvement Trust](/wiki/Singapore_Improvement_Trust) in the backdrop of a rapidly growing population in [post-war Singapore](/wiki/Colony_of_Singapore). The estate later became the basis for the Republic's first new town, Queenstown. ## Geography According to the various master plans laid out by the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority), Bukit Merah is bounded by [Alexandra Canal](/wiki/Alexandra_Canal,_Singapore) and the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River) to the north and HarbourFront and [Keppel Bay](/wiki/Keppel_Harbour) to the south, Kim Seng Road, Outram Road and [Cantonment Road](/wiki/Cantonment_Road,_Singapore) to the east and Alexandra Road to the west. There are 17 subzones within the planning area, including [Alexandra](/wiki/Alexandra,_Bukit_Merah), [Bukit Ho Swee](/wiki/Bukit_Ho_Swee), Bukit Merah, City Terminals, Depot Road, [Everton Park](/wiki/Everton_Park,_Singapore), [HarbourFront](/wiki/HarbourFront), Henderson Hill, Redhill, [Singapore General Hospital](/wiki/Singapore_General_Hospital), [Telok Blangah](/wiki/Telok_Blangah) and [Tiong Bahru](/wiki/Tiong_Bahru). ### Subzones Name of subzonesLocationNotable structuresAccessibility[Alexandra](/wiki/Alexandra,_Singapore)Areas along Alexandra Road, Jalan Bukit Merah, Jalan Rumah Tinggi, and Hoy Fatt RoadAlexandra Primary School, Alexandra Central, Alexandra Village, AIA Building, and IKEA Alexandra[Labrador Park MRT station](/wiki/Labrador_Park_MRT_station), [Redhill MRT station](/wiki/Redhill_MRT_station) and buses[Bukit Ho Swee](/wiki/Bukit_Ho_Swee)Areas along Jalan Bukit Ho Swee and DeltaBeo Crescent Market, Havelock Food Centre, Kim Seng Community Centre, and [Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board](/wiki/Singapore_Examinations_and_Assessment_Board)[Tiong Bahru MRT station](/wiki/Tiong_Bahru_MRT_station), [Havelock MRT station](/wiki/Havelock_MRT_station) and busesBukit MerahAreas along Bukit Merah CentralBukit Merah Town Centre, [Bukit Merah Bus Interchange](/wiki/Bukit_Merah_Bus_Interchange), Bukit Merah Polyclinic, Former HDB Centre, Bukit Merah Secondary School, Gan Eng Seng Primary School, and Wat Ananda Metyarama Thai Buddhist TempleBusesCity Terminals[Pulau Brani](/wiki/Pulau_Brani) and areas near [Keppel Harbour](/wiki/Keppel_Harbour) [Port of Singapore](/wiki/Port_of_Singapore) Keppel Terminal, [Police Coast Guard](/wiki/Police_Coast_Guard) Headquarters and [St. James Power Station](/wiki/St_James_Power_Station)[Keppel MRT station](/wiki/Keppel_MRT_station) (future) and buses.

Today, there are currently 7 [MRT](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) stations that serve the planning area across four lines, the [East West line](/wiki/East_West_MRT_line), [Circle line](/wiki/Circle_Line_(Singapore)), [North East line](/wiki/North_East_Line) and the [Thomson-East Coast line](/wiki/Thomson%E2%80%93East_Coast_Line). HarbourFront MRT station is an interchange station between the North East and Circle lines, and is also the current terminus for both lines. Outram Park MRT station was initially a double-line interchange station between the East-West and North-East lines. Still, it became a triple-line interchange station after the commencement of the third stage of the [Thomson–East Coast line](/wiki/Thomson%E2%80%93East_Coast_Line) in 2022. The seven stations are: - **TE16** [Havelock](/wiki/Havelock_MRT_station) - **EW16** **NE3** **TE17** [Outram Park](/wiki/Outram_Park_MRT_station) - **EW17** [Tiong Bahru](/wiki/Tiong_Bahru_MRT_station) - **EW18** [Redhill](/wiki/Redhill_MRT_station) - **CC27** [Labrador Park](/wiki/Labrador_Park_MRT_station) - **CC28** [Telok Blangah](/wiki/Telok_Blangah_MRT_station) - **NE1** **CC29** [HarbourFront](/wiki/HarbourFront_MRT_station) Future stations that are currently under construction include: - **CC30** [Keppel](/wiki/Keppel_MRT_station) - **CC31** [Cantonment](/wiki/Cantonment_MRT_station) The future stations, [Keppel](/wiki/Keppel_MRT_station) and [Cantonment](/wiki/Cantonment_MRT_station) will be located within the new town as part of Stage 6 of the Circle line that will be completed by 2026. During the 2025 Committee of Supply debate, Minister for Transport [Chee Hong Tat](/wiki/Chee_Hong_Tat) announced that feasibility studies are underway for a proposed MRT line, tentatively named the Tengah line. If found feasible, the line, which will serve areas including Bukit Merah, could be built from the 2040s. ### Bus There are two bus interchanges and one bus terminal in the new town. The [Bukit Merah Bus Interchange](/wiki/Bukit_Merah_Bus_Interchange), which serves Bukit Merah, is located at Bukit Merah Town Centre. Service Number 132 links the Interchange to [Redhill MRT station](/wiki/Redhill_MRT_station) while bus services 5, 16, and 851 link the interchange to [Tiong Bahru MRT station](/wiki/Tiong_Bahru_MRT_station). Two feeder services originate from the interchange serving the [Telok Blangah](/wiki/Telok_Blangah) estate. The [HarbourFront Bus Interchange](/wiki/HarbourFront_Bus_Interchange) is located in the southern part of Bukit Merah, serving nearby amenities such as the [HarbourFront Centre](/wiki/HarbourFront_Centre) and [VivoCity](/wiki/VivoCity), Singapore's largest shopping mall. The [Kampong Bahru Bus Terminal](/wiki/Kampong_Bahru_Bus_Terminal) is located along Spooner Road, near the vicinity of the [Singapore General Hospital](/wiki/Singapore_General_Hospital). ## Education ### Primary schools - Alexandra Primary School - Blangah Rise Primary School - Cantonment Primary School - [CHIJ Kellock](/wiki/CHIJ) - Gan Eng Seng Primary School - Radin Mas Primary School - Zhangde Primary School ### Secondary schools - [Bukit Merah Secondary School](/wiki/Bukit_Merah_Secondary_School) - [CHIJ St. Theresa's Convent](/wiki/CHIJ_Saint_Theresa%27s_Convent) - [Crescent Girls' School](/wiki/Crescent_Girls%27_School) - [Gan Eng Seng School](/wiki/Gan_Eng_Seng_School) ### Tertiary institutions - [Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School](/wiki/Duke-NUS_Graduate_Medical_School) ### Other schools - Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) - APSN Tanglin School - [ISS International School](/wiki/ISS_International_School) (Preston Campus) - [North London Collegiate School](/wiki/North_London_Collegiate_School) (Singapore) - Shelton College International ## Amenities ### Places of worship #### Buddhist temples - [Wat Ananda Metyarama Thai Buddhist Temple](/wiki/Wat_Ananda_Metyarama_Thai_Buddhist_Temple) - Kwan Yam Theng Buddhist Temple - Buddhist Fellowship West Centre, in Yeo's building #### Chinese temples - Ban Siew San Kuan Imm Temple (1880) - Giok Hong Tian Temple (1887) - Hock Teck Tong Temple (1932) - Kai San Temple (1904) - Kim Lan Beo Temple (1830, relocated in 1984) - Leng San Teng Temple (1879) - Koon Seng Ting Temple (1880) - Lei Yin Temple (1957) - Qi Tian Gong Temple (1920) - Qi Tian Tan Temple (1949) - Tai Yeong Kon Temple (1947) - Tang Gah Beo Temple - Telok Blangah Ting Kong Beo Temple (1923) #### Chinese clan temples - Lim See Tai Chong Soo Kiu Leong Tong Temple - San Jiang Gong Ci Temple #### Chinese combined temples - Chia Leng Kong Heng Kang Tian Temple - Chin Leng Keng (Leng San Teng, Chin Lin Keng & Ban Sian Beo) - Temple of Liang Hong Sze Kong Hock Keng Heap Hoe Keng #### Churches - Grace Assembly of God 1 - Church of God Singapore - Church of St. Teresa - [Danish Seamen's Church](/wiki/Danish_Seamen%27s_Church_and_Church_Abroad) - Grace Methodist Church - Pasir Panjang Tamil Methodist Church - [St. Matthew's Church](/wiki/St._Matthew%27s_Church,_Singapore) - [Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church](/wiki/Telok_Ayer_Chinese_Methodist_Church) #### Hindu temples - [Sri Ruthra Kaliamman Temple](/wiki/Sri_Ruthra_Kaliamman_Temple) #### Mosques - Masjid Al-Amin Mosque - Masjid Jamiyah Ar-Rabitah Mosque - Masjid Kampong Delta Mosque - [Masjid Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim](/wiki/Masjid_Temenggong_Daeng_Ibrahim) #### Sikh temples - Gurdwara Sahib Silat Road ### Shopping centres - Alexandra Central - Alexandra Retail Centre - Concorde Shopping Centre - Depot Heights Shopping Centre - [HarbourFront Centre](/wiki/HarbourFront_Centre) - [Tiong Bahru Plaza](/wiki/Tiong_Bahru_Plaza) - [VivoCity](/wiki/VivoCity) ### Parks - [Alexandra Canal Linear Park](/wiki/Alexandra_Canal,_Singapore) - Alexandra Hill East Neighbourhood Park - Bukit Purmei Hillock Park - Henderson Park - Kim Pong Park - [Labrador Nature Reserve](/wiki/Labrador_Nature_Reserve) - [Mount Faber Park](/wiki/Mount_Faber) - [Rail Corridor](/wiki/Rail_Corridor_(Singapore)) (South) - Rumah Tinggi Eco Park - [Telok Blangah Hill Park](/wiki/Telok_Blangah_Hill_Park) - [Tiong Bahru Park](/wiki/Tiong_Bahru_Park) ### Community centres/clubs - Bukit Merah Community Centre - Henderson Community Club - Kim Seng Community Centre - Leng Kee Community Centre - Radin Mas Community Club - Telok Blangah Community Club - Tiong Bahru Community Centre ### Sports facilities - [Delta Sports Complex](/wiki/Delta_Sports_Complex) - SAFRA Mount Faber - Sports Lifestyle Centre ### Tourist attractions - Amped Trampoline Park - [Baba House](/wiki/Baba_House) - Berlayer Beacon - Bukit Chermin Broadwalk - [Former Tanjong Pagar Railway Station](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar_railway_station) (Temporarily closed for restoration works) - [Gillman Barracks](/wiki/Gillman_Barracks) - [Henderson Waves](/wiki/Henderson_Waves) - [Singapore Art Museum](/wiki/Singapore_Art_Museum) (SAM) at Tanjong Pagar Distripark - [Singapore Cable Car](/wiki/Singapore_Cable_Car) stations at Mount Faber and HarbourFront - The SGH Museum ## Politics Bukit Merah falls within six political divisions across four constituencies.
