She is the first woman from [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) to reach the [South Pole](/wiki/South_Pole). ## Biography Pang graduated from [Nanyang Business School](/wiki/Nanyang_Business_School) in 1994. Before Pang left on her [Antarctic](/wiki/Antarctic) expedition, she used to teach classes as a freelance fitness instructor. In August 2008, she found an online application for women to represent their country in [Antarctica](/wiki/Antarctica) and she decided to apply. She eventually beat out 70 other applicants to take the spot to travel to the [South Pole](/wiki/South_Pole). She joined a team, that was later funded by [Kaspersky Lab](/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab), called the [Kaspersky Commonwealth Antarctic Expedition](/wiki/Kaspersky_Commonwealth_Antarctic_Expedition), and which included women from [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand), [Jamaica](/wiki/Jamaica), [India](/wiki/India), [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom), [Cyprus](/wiki/Cyprus), [Ghana](/wiki/Ghana) and [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei). Pang was the person who secured the Kaspersky sponsorship for the team by contacting their Singapore distributor. Pang underwent a five-month training program to get ready for the trip. The expedition left on 22 November 2009 from Messner Start, which is around 900 kilometers from the pole. Pang and her team reached the South Pole at around 10 am, Singapore Time, on 30 December 2009. Pang was inducted into the [Singapore Women's Hall of Fame](/wiki/Singapore_Women%27s_Hall_of_Fame) in 2014.\n",
