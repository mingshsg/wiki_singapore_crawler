It is a pan-Asian branch of the U.S.-based [CNBC](/wiki/CNBC). The channel launched on 20 June 1995 out of [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong). In 1998, the channel merged with [Dow Jones](/wiki/Dow_Jones)' [Asia Business News](/wiki/Asia_Business_News) and relocated to its facilities in Singapore. The network maintains bureaus across the [Asia–Pacific](/wiki/Asia%E2%80%93Pacific) region. ## History CNBC Asia was announced in 1995 as a localised version of [CNBC](/wiki/CNBC) for the [Asia-Pacific](/wiki/Asia-Pacific) region. The network was expected to feature 10 hours of programming per day from its studio in [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong), along with bureaus in [Bombay](/wiki/Mumbai), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), and [Tokyo](/wiki/Tokyo). The rest of its programming would be sourced from [CNBC Europe](/wiki/CNBC_Europe) and its U.S. counterpart. [NBC Asia](/wiki/NBC_Asia) chairman Patrick Cox expected that the network would reach five million homes by the end of its first year on-air. In January 1995, a [\"preview\"](/wiki/Soft_launch) known as **ANBC** launched, which carried a mix of programming from [CNBC US](/wiki/CNBC) and CNBC Europe on [Galaxy](/wiki/Galaxy_(Australian_television)) in Australia and [Wharf Cable](/wiki/I-Cable_Communications) in Hong Kong. CNBC Asia officially launched on 20 June 1995. The network would be a competitor to the Singapore-based [Asia Business News](/wiki/Asia_Business_News) (ABN), a joint venture between [Dow Jones & Company](/wiki/Dow_Jones_%26_Company), [Tele-Communications Inc.](/wiki/Tele-Communications_Inc.), [TVNZ](/wiki/TVNZ), and other local investors which launched in 1993. There were doubts that the two competing business news channels in the market would be viable; ABN CEO Paul France derided CNBC Asia as being \"an Asian branch of an American company.\" However, as early as November 1995, it was reported that NBC and Dow Jones were considering a merger of their business news channels in Asia and Europe, including ABN and its European counterpart, [European Business News](/wiki/European_Business_News) (EBN). In March 1997, CNBC Asia expanded its carriage on cable in India via an agreement with the [Hinduja Group](/wiki/Hinduja_Group). ### Merger with ABN Renewed negotiations between NBC and Dow Jones surfaced in November 1997 amid financial difficulties at the companies' Asian and European operations. Dow Jones had been operating at a loss of US$48 million, and CNBC at $40 million. On 10 December 1997, Dow Jones and NBC announced a 15-year strategic partnership, under which ABN and EBN would merge with CNBC Asia and CNBC Europe, respectively, and CNBC US would be able to enter into editorial partnerships with Dow Jones publications such as *[The Wall Street Journal](/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal)* and *[Barron's](/wiki/Barron%27s)*. The merged operation would retain the CNBC branding, but be overseen by Paul France, and relocate to ABN's Singapore studios—resulting in layoffs of 150 employees from its Hong Kong bureau, with many of whom were hired by the upstart [Bloomberg Television Asia–Pacific](/wiki/Bloomberg_Television#Current_channels) channel which took over the ABN's channel space and CNBC Asia's original Hong Kong headquarters. The merger took effect on-air on 2 February 1998, with the channel being rebranded as **CNBC–Asia Business News** for a transitional period. Citing cost issues and a plan to focus exclusively on Asian business news, simulcasts of CNBC US programmes were dropped from its overnight schedule in favour of reruns of domestic programmes. After the decision was poorly received by viewers, CNBC's U.S. business day programmes were reinstated in March. The merger impacted ABN's Indian network, ABNi, which was a joint venture with Hinduja Group and [TV18](/wiki/TV18); prior to the announcement of the Dow Jones agreement, Hinduja had sold its stake in the channel, and TV18's agreement on the venture did not contain any provisions on what would occur in the event of a change in ownership. After discussions with a CNBC lawyer and France, TV18 would reach an agreement with CNBC to serve as its Indian partner, and would also launch CNBC India (now [CNBC TV18](/wiki/CNBC_TV18)) the following year. In October 1999, CNBC Asia had a partnership with the *[Australian Financial Review](/wiki/Australian_Financial_Review)* to present *The Australian Financial Review Market Wrap*, a daily round-up of market news from the Australian region hosted by James Walker and Grace Phan. Major programming changes occurred on 30 October 2000 with CNBC Asia expanding *[Asia Squawk Box](/wiki/Asia_Squawk_Box)* to two hours, *Asia Market Watch* to two hours in the morning and 1½ hours in the afternoon and *Power Lunch Asia* to one full hour. CNBC Asia's ticker was also reformatted on that day to include colours reflecting a change in the stock prices (green for an increase and red for a decrease) and a stock's ticker symbol. In 2001, CNBC Asia introduced localised tickers to audiences in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore and has since kept the ticker on the screen during commercial breaks. In July 2001, *Asia Squawk Box* was further extended to three hours and more programming hours from [CNBC US](/wiki/CNBC) and [CNBC Europe](/wiki/CNBC_Europe) were added to the line-up. This was further extended in 2002 when U.S. programming started at 20.00 UTC+8 time uninterrupted on weeknights. ### 2005–present: Post-merger In July 2005, Dow Jones exited its joint ventures with CNBC, putting them entirely under the ownership of [NBC Universal](/wiki/NBCUniversal). In March 2007, CNBC Asia announced that it would expand its presence in Australia, including establishing a new [Sydney](/wiki/Sydney) bureau (initially based out of a local [GE](/wiki/General_Electric) office, with a studio under construction at the [Burns Philp Building](/wiki/Burns_Philp_Building,_Sydney) across from Sydney Exchange Square), and premiering *[Squawk Australia](/wiki/Squawk_Australia)—*an hour-long program preceding *Asia Squawk Box* to cover the opening of the Australian markets. The following month, CNBC launched *[Worldwide Exchange](/wiki/Worldwide_Exchange)*, a new international business program that would be simulcast across CNBC in Asia, Europe, and the United States. CNBC Asia also launched two brand new shows that replaced *Market Watch* and the CNBC Europe programme *Today's Business;* *[CNBC's Cash Flow](/wiki/CNBC%27s_Cash_Flow)*, anchored by Maura Fogarty (first hour) and Amanda Drury (second hour), was originally intensely trader and investor based. Following the success of *Worldwide Exchange*, another joint production, *[Capital Connection](/wiki/Capital_Connection_(TV_series)),* was launched. It was originally anchored by Maura Fogarty in Singapore and Steve Sedgwick in [London](/wiki/London). Unlike *Worldwide Exchange*, which was originally produced by [CNBC Europe](/wiki/CNBC_Europe) (until production of that show was relocated to CNBC US on 4 January 2016), *Capital Connection* was produced by CNBC Asia. On 27 September 2007, CNBC Asia announced two additional shows from Sydney, *[Trading Matters](/wiki/Trading_Matters)*—a wrap-up of the day's market action, and *[Australia This Week](/wiki/Australia_This_Week)*. Both shows were anchored by then-newly appointed CNBC anchor Oriel Morrison, formerly of the [Nine Network](/wiki/Nine_Network) and [Bloomberg Television](/wiki/Bloomberg_Television). The shows debuted on 2 and 6 October 2007, respectively, as the channel officially opened its new Burns Philip Building studios. The move also saw CNBC Australia reintroduce opt-outs from the pan-Asian feed for additional airings of *Trading Matters* and *Australia This Week*. In August 2008, *[The Daily Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph)* reported that Channel Nine's finance reporter Karen Tso, would be joining the network in October 2008. She became the Sydney-based correspondent of CNBC and anchored *Squawk Australia*, thus replacing Jeffrey James. In mid-2009, CNBC Asia launched a new personal finance show as an opt-out in Australia, *The Barefoot Investor*, with Australian personal finance expert Scott Pape. In June 2010, CNBC Asia relocated to a new studio at the [Singapore Exchange](/wiki/Singapore_Exchange). This coincided with changes to the network's lineup, including the cancellation of *Squawk Australia* and re-expansion of *Asia Squawk Box* to a three-hour format, and the new program *[The Call](/wiki/The_Call_(American_TV_program))*. On 31 March 2014, CNBC replaced *The Call* and *Cash Flow* with the early morning show *[The Rundown](/wiki/The_Rundown_(CNBC_Asia))* and a local version of *[Street Signs](/wiki/Street_Signs_(TV_series)). Asia* *Squawk Box* also relocated to a new studio in Hong Kong. In 2019, *Asia Squawk Box* returned to Singapore with a new anchor lineup. In June 2023, CNBC Asia set up a new office in Mapletree Business City. Facilities include a master control room, a production control room for social media platforms and a small studio. On 22 July 2024, CNBC Asia updated its on-air presentation and branding to match the new CNBC US branding that was first introduced on 11 December 2023. On 7 April 2025, CNBC Asia revamped its programming schedule by introducing the new programmes *US Markets Edition* (which provides highlights of CNBC's previous American trading day coverage), *The China Connection*, *Inside India*, and *Access Middle East.* ## Programming ### Weekday line-up CNBC Asia produces live business day programming from 06:00 to 13:00 [SIN](/wiki/Singapore_Time) (UTC+08:00) time during DST or 06:00 to 14:00 [SIN](/wiki/Singapore_Time) without DST. The channel's weekday business day programmes (pan-Asian feed) are: - *US Markets Edition* – [Brian Sullivan](/wiki/Brian_Sullivan_(news_anchor)) ([Englewood Ciffs](/wiki/Englewood_Cliffs), [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey)) (Tuesday - Friday) - *[Squawk Box Asia](/wiki/Squawk_Box_Asia)* – Chery Kang (Hong Kong) and [Martin Soong](/wiki/Martin_Soong) (Singapore) - *The China Connection* – Emily Tan (Hong Kong) - *Inside India* – Amitoj Singh (Singapore) - *Access: Middle East* – Dan Murphy In addition, CNBC Asia produces a weekly interview show - *Managing Asia*, presented by [Christine Tan](/wiki/Christine_Tan).

Back-to-back editions of *[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon](/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Jimmy_Fallon)* are shown during the evening. ### End-of-year programming On trading days over the Christmas and new year period, CNBC Asia massively cuts back its regional programming with live output restricted to a two-hour edition of *[Squawk Box Asia](/wiki/Squawk_Box_Asia)*.

In Europe, during the mid to late 2000s, CNBC Europe had chosen to scale back simulcasts of CNBC Asia programming overnight in favour of teleshopping and later poker games, and CNBC Asia's entire morning line-up had only been seen on Monday mornings. During the rest of the week, only the second hour of *Street Signs* and *Capital Connection* were seen on [CNBC Europe](/wiki/CNBC_Europe). However, in 2009, CNBC Europe began showing almost the entire CNBC Asia schedule throughout the week, joining CNBC Asia at midnight UK time, 1am CET, with the full schedule broadcast on Monday mornings. The April 2025 schedule changes saw CNBC Europe broadcast the entire CNBC Asia programming block every day for the first time. Since 23 April 2007, a free live and commercial-free stream of CNBC Asia has been available on CNBC.com every Monday, from 6 AM to 4 PM SIN time (Sundays 6 PM to 4 AM ET with [DST](/wiki/Daylight_saving_time)). At other times, the stream can be accessed by subscribing to CNBC Plus, which costs $9.95/month or $99.95/year. Furthermore, *[Worldwide Exchange](/wiki/Worldwide_Exchange)* is not shown on Fridays due to clashing with weekend shows (*Inside China*, *The Edge*) and *Managing Asia*. ## On-air staff Staff are based in Singapore unless stated otherwise. ### Current - [Amanda Drury](/wiki/Amanda_Drury) ([Sydney](/wiki/Sydney)) - [Tanvir Gill](/wiki/Tanvir_Gill) - Chery Kang ([Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong)) - Kaori Enjoji ([Tokyo](/wiki/Tokyo)) - JP Ong – South-east Asia reporter - Lin Lin - Dan Murphy - Amitoj Singh - [Martin Soong](/wiki/Martin_Soong) - [Christine Tan](/wiki/Christine_Tan) - Emily Tan (Hong Kong) – senior correspondent covering China, Hong Kong and Taiwan markets - Samantha Vadas – China correspondent - [Eunice Yoon](/wiki/Eunice_Yoon) ([Beijing](/wiki/Beijing)) – chief [China](/wiki/China) correspondent ### Former #### Anchors/presenters - [Andrea Catherwood](/wiki/Andrea_Catherwood) (now presenting and contributing to programmes in the UK) - Aaron Heslehurst (now with [BBC World News](/wiki/BBC_World_News)) - [Rico Hizon](/wiki/Rico_Hizon) (later with [BBC World News](/wiki/BBC_World_News) and [CNN Philippines](/wiki/CNN_Philippines), now with [ANC](/wiki/ABS-CBN_News_Channel)) - Nancy Hungerford (left CNBC on July 2, 2021) - [Fauziah Ibrahim](/wiki/Fauziah_Ibrahim) (now with [ABC News (Australia)](/wiki/ABC_News_(Australia))) - [Jeffrey James](/wiki/Jeffrey_James) (now based in China) - Sri Jegarajah - Mark Laudi (now runs his own consultancy, Mark Laudi and Associates) - [May Lee](/wiki/May_Lee) (her \"Oprah\"-style talk show on STAR World premiered in May 2008) - [Susan Li](/wiki/Susan_Li) (moved to [CNBC Europe](/wiki/CNBC_Europe) and later to [CNBC US](/wiki/CNBC); left in August 2017, now with [Fox Business](/wiki/Fox_Business)) - [Bernard Lo](/wiki/Bernard_Lo) - [Dalton Tanonaka](/wiki/Dalton_Tanonaka) (now with [Metro TV](/wiki/Metro_TV_(Indonesia))) - Karen Tso (now based at [CNBC Europe](/wiki/CNBC_Europe) as co-anchor of *[Squawk Box Europe](/wiki/Squawk_Box_Europe)*) #### Correspondents - Tracey Chang (now with [CCTV](/wiki/China_Central_Television)) - [Geoff Cutmore](/wiki/Geoff_Cutmore) (later with CNBC Europe, hosting *[Squawk Box Europe](/wiki/Squawk_Box_Europe)* until June 2023) - Stephen Engle (now with Bloomberg Television as their Beijing correspondent) - [Cheng Lei (journalist)](/wiki/Cheng_Lei_(journalist)) (arrested in February 2021 \"on suspicion of illegally supplying state secrets overseas\") - [Betty Liu](/wiki/Betty_Liu) (later with Bloomberg Television, [New York](/wiki/New_York_City) studios; left the television industry in May 2018) - Jane Ong (now with Burson-Marsteller Asia Pacific) - [Colette Wong](/wiki/Colette_Wong) (later with [Fox Sports Asia](/wiki/Fox_Sports_Asia) and [Fox Sports News Asia](/wiki/Fox_Sports_News_(Asia)) until its demise in September 2021) ## Other CNBC Asia Services and partnerships ### CNBC-based channels In conjunction with local partners it provides the following local channels: - [CNBC TV18](/wiki/CNBC_TV18) (in India, formerly CNBC India) - CNBC Infinitey (in India) - [CNBC Awaaz](/wiki/CNBC_Awaaz) (in India) - [CNBC Bajar](/wiki/CNBC_Bajar) (in India) - CNBC Prime (in India) - CNBC Tamilin (in India) - [Nikkei CNBC](/wiki/Nikkei_CNBC) (in Japan) - [CNBC Pakistan](/wiki/CNBC_Pakistan) (now closed) - [SBS-CNBC](/wiki/SBS-CNBC) (in Korea) - [CNBC Indonesia](/wiki/CNBC_Indonesia) (in Indonesia) - [JKN-CNBC](/wiki/JKN-CNBC) (in Thailand) ### Other TV and print partners - [Seoul Broadcasting System](/wiki/Seoul_Broadcasting_System) (SBS) (in [South Korea](/wiki/South_Korea)) - Formerly MBN CNBC was also provided in Korea.
