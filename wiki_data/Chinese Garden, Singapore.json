  "content": "Park in Jurong East, Singapore **Chinese Garden**[a] is a park in [Jurong East](/wiki/Jurong_East), Singapore. Built in 1975 by the [JTC Corporation](/wiki/JTC_Corporation), the Chinese Garden's concept is based on Chinese gardening art. The main characteristic is the integration of architectural features with the natural environment. The Chinese Garden is modelled along the northern Chinese imperial style of architecture and landscaping. It is located next to [Chinese Garden MRT station](/wiki/Chinese_Garden_MRT_station) and connected to the adjacent [Japanese Garden](/wiki/Japanese_Garden,_Singapore) by two bridges. Along with Japanese Garden and Lakeside Gardens, which was opened in 2019, the three gardens are collectively known as the **Jurong Lake Gardens**. ## History Plans for the construction of the Chinese Garden were first mentioned in 1968 by Woon Wah Siang, the chairman of the [JTC Corporation](/wiki/JTC_Corporation). [Earthworks](/wiki/Earthworks_(engineering)) began in 1968, and planning of the design was finalized in 1970, with construction beginning in 1971. The garden was completed in 1975 at a cost of [S$](/wiki/Singapore_dollar)4.7 million and was opened by then-Finance Minister [Hon Sui Sen](/wiki/Hon_Sui_Sen). In February 1989, the East Entrance was opened, following the opening of [Chinese Garden MRT station](/wiki/Chinese_Garden_MRT_station), to ensure easy access for pedestrians visiting the gardens. Chinese Garden was later closed from March to July 1989 to undergo renovation works. In 2014, a year-long \"redecoration and refurbishment\" project was launched. The areas to be repaired included the main entrance plaza, the pavilions, the pagodas, the Stone Boat, and footpaths. The repair works involved removing wood that had rotted or become infested by termites. This also included patching up spalling concrete and cracked walls, replacing broken and loose roof tiles, stopping water leakage, as well as replacing old electrical wiring, timber footpaths, or rusted fittings. In May 2019, the Chinese Garden and the adjacent [Japanese Garden](/wiki/Japanese_Garden,_Singapore) were closed for extensive renovation. The gardens reopened in September 2024 with a new aquatic garden with 150 different types of [water lilies](/wiki/Nymphaeaceae). A new exhibit, Sunken Garden, was also introduced that featured 200 types of [epiphytes](/wiki/Epiphyte). Previous features such as the Twin Pagoda, Grand Arch, and the Stone Boat were refurbished, while others, such as the main building and courtyards, were demolished. ## Features ### Stone Lions A pair of cloudy-grained marble stone lions at the main gates of the Chinese Garden, guarding the main gates of the garden. The marble stone used to sculpt the lions was imported from [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan). ### Bridge The 13-arch White Rainbow Bridge[b] at the garden follows the style of the Seventeen-Arch Bridge at the [Summer Palace](/wiki/Summer_Palace) in [Peking](/wiki/Beijing). In 1989, a second bridge, the \"Bridge of Double Beauty,\" was built to connect the Chinese Garden with the Japanese Garden. In the 2024 redevelopment, a third bridge, the *Moonrise Bridge* was built, serving as a second connection from the Chinese Garden to the Japanese Garden. ### Grand Arch The Grand Arch Building is a standard [Chinese arch building](/wiki/Paifang). Inside, there were two [courtyards](/wiki/Courtyards), namely the “Early Spring Courtyard” and “Garden Courtyard”. Additionally, there was a [fishpond](/wiki/Fish_pond) in the centre, named the “Fish Paradise”. The main building within the Grand Arch, together with its courtyards, Chinese-style walls, and moon gates, was demolished in the 2024 redevelopment and replaced with a [mass-engineered timber](/wiki/Engineered_wood) structure. It now houses the Jurong Lake Gardens Gallery and a restaurant. ### Stone Boat and Tea Pavilion The design of the Stone Boat[c] in Chinese Garden incorporates the traditional Peking style, but with some adaptations in the design and usage of materials. The Tea Pavilion[d] features three pavilions inspired by the style of the elaborate, winding gallery at the [Summer Palace](/wiki/Summer_Palace). This meandering design is a characteristic and graceful Chinese architectural feature. ### Bamboo Grove and Waterfall Built in the 2024 redevelopment, the Bamboo Grove pays homage to the rich cultural symbolism of bamboo in traditional Chinese culture, representing moral integrity, resilience, and elegance. The waterfall, located within the bamboo grove, helps to cool the surrounding area through the wind it generates. ### Cloud Pagoda In ancient times, [pagodas](/wiki/Pagoda), originally simple tower structures located beside temples, were used for the storage of human ashes (in urns) by [Buddhists](/wiki/Buddhists). The 7-storey Cloud Pagoda[e] is situated on a small hill in the Chinese Garden, known as the Cloud Pagoda Plateau[f]. Its typical pagoda design follows the style of [Linggu Temple](/wiki/Linggu_Temple) Pagoda at [Nanjing](/wiki/Nanjing). The pagoda is surrounded by 12 animal stone sculptures of the [Chinese zodiac](/wiki/Chinese_zodiac). ### Twin Pagodas The Twin Pagodas[g] are designed based on the [Spring and Autumn Pavilions](/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_Pavilions) in Taiwan. They consist of two three-story pagodas, namely the Cloud Draping Tower[h] and Moon Receiving Tower.[i] The designs of the Twin Pagodas embody the [Yin-Yang](/wiki/Yin_and_yang) principle, with the broader tower representing Yang and the slender tower representing Yin. ### Bonsai Garden Opened in June 1992, the Suzhou-style [Bonsai](/wiki/Bonsai) Garden cost an estimated $3.8 million to build. This 5,800-square-metre garden, featuring [Suzhou](/wiki/Suzhou)-style buildings (including a main hall of 50 square metres) and landscape houses, showcases a collection of over 2,000 bonsais imported from China and other parts of the world. It is designed as the largest Suzhou-style Bonsai garden of its kind outside of China. ### Water Wall Court Constructed during the 2024 redevelopment, the Water Wall Court features a courtyard and pavilion, surrounded by shallow pools and 3 metre-high water walls. ### Cascading Creek Replacing the former Garden of Abundance in the 2024 redevelopment, the Cascading Creek is a [riverine habitat](/wiki/River_ecosystem) showcasing Southeast Asian flora and fauna. It features a boardwalk trail with five stages: Fern Cascades, Hill Streams, Kasai Creek, Paperback Swamp, and Nypa Grove. ## Former features ### Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum, a primary attraction in the Chinese Garden, exhibits various species of turtles and [tortoises](/wiki/Tortoise). In 2019, the museum moved out from the gardens and relocated to [Yishun](/wiki/Yishun); this was due to upgrading works carried out in the surrounding [Jurong Lake District](/wiki/Jurong_Lake_District). The Chinese-style pavilion that once housed it was subsequently demolished. ### Garden of Abundance The original name of this garden was the Zodiac & Pomegranate Garden, derived from the elements used for the construction of the garden. It consisted of [pomegranate](/wiki/Pomegranate) trees, the 12 Chinese Zodiac animals sculpture, a [sundial](/wiki/Sundial), stone bridges, and planting of materials. 100-year-old pomegranate trees from Shantung, China, were planted in the garden. They sat among the 12 Chinese Zodiac Animal sculptures. The Garden of Abundance was replaced by the Harvest Moon Terrace, Cascading Creek, and Cascade Pavilion in the 2024 redevelopment. The 12 Zodiac animal sculptures were relocated below the Cloud Pagoda. ### Notes ### Citations - Official website: Chinese Garden - Your Singapore - Chinese Garden - 360° X 360° Interactive VR of the Singapore Chinese Gardens\n",
