  "content": "Peranakan dish made of chicken **Ayam buah keluak** is a traditional [Peranakan](/wiki/Peranakan) dish consisting of [chicken](/wiki/Chicken_as_food) (*ayam*), [tamarind](/wiki/Tamarind) gravy and *[buah keluak](/wiki/Buah_keluak)* nuts. It is normally served with [rice](/wiki/Rice). It is also one of the favorite dishes of Singapore's founding [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore), [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) and his son, [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong). ## Description *Ayam buak keluak* is a famous Peranakan dish which can be found in [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine), [Malaysian](/wiki/Malaysian_cuisine) and [Singaporean cuisine](/wiki/Singaporean_cuisine). *Keluak* and the tamarind gravy being the most important ingredient, it is one of the most time-consuming Peranakan dishes to make. The spicy gravy consists of several spices including [candlenuts](/wiki/Candle_nuts), [turmeric](/wiki/Turmeric), [chilli](/wiki/Chili_pepper), [galanga](/wiki/Galanga) and [belacan](/wiki/Belacan). [Lemongrass](/wiki/Lemongrass) and the flesh of the keluak will be added after the gravy was fried fragrant. Then part of the mixture will be mixed with chicken and then filled back into the *keluak* nut, and the rest of the mixture will be made into a thick gravy with chicken soup and tamarind juice. This dish is normally served with rice. Usually, people will consume the chicken, gravy and the mixture in the keluak nut. ## History Although most Peranakan dishes were influenced by [Hokkien](/wiki/Fujian_cuisine) and [Malay cuisine](/wiki/Malay_cuisine), *ayam buah keluak* was influenced more by Indonesian cuisine since *keluak* is originally from Indonesia's [mangrove](/wiki/Mangrove) [swamps](/wiki/Swamp). It was brought to [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca) from [Java](/wiki/Java) and [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra) when Malacca was an important trading port in the 15th century. ## Variants Peranakans and Eurasians cook this dish in different ways. Peranakans usually remove the flesh from the nut, mix it with chicken, fill them back into the nut and then cook them in curry while Eurasians cook it in [curry](/wiki/Curry) without taking out the flesh. Sometimes chicken can be replaced by pork. This dish is important to Peranakans who use the dish as a tribute to their ancestors. In Eurasian culture, this dish is considered a luxury. - [List of Indonesian soups](/wiki/List_of_Indonesian_soups) - [Rawon](/wiki/Rawon) - [Peranakan cuisine](/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine) - [Eurasian cuisine of Singapore and Malaysia](/wiki/Eurasian_cuisine_of_Singapore_and_Malaysia) - [Javanese cuisine](/wiki/Javanese_cuisine) - [Indo cuisine](/wiki/Indo_cuisine) - [Malay cuisine](/wiki/Malay_cuisine) - Ayam buah keluak recipe Portals: - Food - Indonesia - Malaysia - Singapore\n",
