  "content": "Singaporean politician **Bernard Rodrigues** (15 March 1933 – 17 August 2015) was a Singaporean politician. Rodrigues represented [Telok Blangah](/wiki/Telok_Blangah) as a legislative assemblyman in the [1st Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/1st_Parliament_of_Singapore) from 1965 until 1968. He was a founding member of the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) and helped establish the [National Trades Union Congress](/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress) (NTUC). Rodrigues argued that making the NTUC effective was in the best interest of Singapore, as it would be a constructive alternative to pro-Communist movements. In 1966, he campaigned for government employees to receive their entitled backpay, clashing with [Lim Kim San](/wiki/Lim_Kim_San) who discouraged such a move. Rodrigues relocated to Sydney, Australia in 1972. This article about a politician from Singapore is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it. - v - t - e\n",
