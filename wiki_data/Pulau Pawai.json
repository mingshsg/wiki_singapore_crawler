It is located off the southwestern coast of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), between [Pulau Sudong](/wiki/Pulau_Sudong) to its north and [Pulau Satumu](/wiki/Pulau_Satumu) to its south. It is one of the three islands owned by the Singapore Armed Forces for [live firing exercises](/wiki/Live_fire_exercise), the other two being Pulau Sudong and [Pulau Senang](/wiki/Pulau_Senang). ## Live Firing Area (Southern Islands) Since 9 June 1989, the island together with [Pulau Senang](/wiki/Pulau_Senang) and [Pulau Sudong](/wiki/Pulau_Sudong), these three islands formed the [Singapore Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces) southern islands [military](/wiki/Military) training area and live-firing zone. As with all other military installations within the country, the entire live-firing zone is strictly off limits to all civilians at all times of the day and night. The island is used mainly as a practice range for live-ammunition bombing both from the air and the ground. The [Republic of Singapore Air Force](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force) and [Navy](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Navy) take turns to use it, with the Air Force practicing strafing and the Navy practicing shelling targets. Pawai's lush green and brown forests are mostly undisturbed and it has been found to have a rich biodiversity of [coral reefs](/wiki/Coral_reefs), especially [fringing reefs](/wiki/Fringing_reef). ## Etymology \"Pawai\" means cortège ([French](/wiki/French_language): *procession, retinue*) or suite of the Raja, so presumably the retinue of the Raja stayed on this island. ## Panorama This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
