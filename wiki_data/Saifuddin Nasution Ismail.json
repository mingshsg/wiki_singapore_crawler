He served as the [Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs](/wiki/Minister_of_Domestic_Trade_and_Costs_of_Living_(Malaysia)) in the PH administration under former Prime Minister [Mahathir Mohamad](/wiki/Mahathir_Mohamad) from July 2018 to the collapse of the PH administration in February 2020, [Member of Parliament](/wiki/Dewan_Rakyat) (MP) for [Kulim-Bandar Baharu](/wiki/Kulim-Bandar_Baharu) from May 2018 to November 2022 and for [Machang](/wiki/Machang_(federal_constituency)) from March 2008 to May 2013 as well as Member of the [Penang State Legislative Assembly](/wiki/Penang_State_Legislative_Assembly) (MLA) for [Pantai Jerejak](/wiki/Pantai_Jerejak_(state_constituency)) from May 2018 to August 2023 and [Kedah](/wiki/Kedah_State_Legislative_Assembly) MLA for [Lunas](/wiki/Lunas_(state_constituency)) from November 2000 to March 2004.

He has also served as the Chief Secretary of PH since March 2020, State Chairman of PH of [Kedah](/wiki/Kedah) since February 2025 and Advisor of the Management Committee of PKR since September 2024. He previously served as the Secretary-General of PKR from January 2010 to his resignation in October 2014 and again from November 2016 to September 2024. ## Early life and education Saifuddin Nasution bin Ismail was born in [State of Singapore, Malaysia](/wiki/Singapore_in_Malaysia) on 7 December 1963. The name 'Nasution' can be linked to the lineage of [Batak Mandailing](/wiki/Mandailing_people) in [Central Sumatra](/wiki/Central_Sumatra), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia). Saifuddin Nasution received his [Bachelor of Science](/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science) (BSc) in [Agriculture](/wiki/Agriculture) from [Universiti Pertanian Malaysia](/wiki/University_of_Putra_Malaysia) (UPM) in 1987. ## Political career Saifuddin was initially a member of [UMNO Youth](/wiki/UMNO_Youth) wing of the ruling party but was expelled in 1999 as its assistant secretary. An ally of [Anwar Ibrahim](/wiki/Anwar_Ibrahim), Saifuddin then defected to the opposition KeADILan party, which later became PKR. Saifuddin election debut was in the [1999 general election](/wiki/1999_Malaysian_general_election) contesting the seat of [Padang Serai](/wiki/Padang_Serai), Kedah for PKR but lost. A year later, he won the [Kedah State Assembly](/wiki/Kedah_State_Legislative_Assembly) seat of [Lunas](/wiki/Lunas,_Kedah) in a [2000 by-election](/wiki/2000_Lunas_by-election). However, he failed in his bid to be elevated to the [federal Parliament](/wiki/Dewan_Rakyat) in the [2004 election](/wiki/2004_Malaysian_general_election), losing to Lim Bee Kau of the [Barisan Nasional](/wiki/Barisan_Nasional) in the seat of Padang Serai again. In the [2008 election](/wiki/2008_Malaysian_general_election), Saifuddin contested and won the federal seat of Machang in Kelantan. For the [2013 election](/wiki/2013_Malaysian_general_election), he returned to Kedah to contest the seat of [Kulim-Bandar Baharu](/wiki/Kulim-Bandar_Baharu), but was defeated by UMNO's [Abdul Aziz Sheikh Fadzir](/wiki/Abdul_Aziz_Sheikh_Fadzir). Fortunately in the [2018 general election](/wiki/2018_Malaysian_general_election), Saifuddin made a comeback to win both the Kulim-Bandar Baharu parliamentary seat and Pantai Jerejak, Penang state seat but lost his parliamentary seat in (/wiki/2022_Malaysian_general_election). He later was appointed as a Senator to serve as a minister in [Anwar Ibrahim cabinet](/wiki/Anwar_Ibrahim_cabinet). In January 2010, Saifuddin was appointed the Secretary-General of PKR, replacing Salehuddin Hashim. In the [2014 party election](/wiki/2014_People%27s_Justice_Party_leadership_election), he vacated the post to run for the party's deputy presidency, but was defeated by [Mohamed Azmin Ali](/wiki/Azmin_Ali). He was once again appointed to the post of PKR Secretary-General in November 2016, this time to replace [Rafizi Ramli](/wiki/Rafizi_Ramli). He once again ran for the Deputy President post in the [2022 party election](/wiki/2022_People%27s_Justice_Party_leadership_election), but ultimately lost to Rafizi Ramli. ## Controversies and issues ### Comment about Kimanis detainees On 9 December 2022, Saifuddin stated that he had been briefed by Immigration Department officials about a viral video and photos circulating on social media, depicting emaciated detainees allegedly at the Kimanis detention center who were seen appealing to be freed and speaking about their ill-treatment. He expressed that it was 'unfair' for the issue to be sensationalized and urged the media to report objectively. Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) had expressed that it was unacceptable and contrary to good governance for Saifuddin to outrightly dismiss the complaints made by a detainee in a video, instead of ordering an inquiry. ### Sosma On 13 December 2022, Saifuddin stated that a review of [Sosma](/wiki/Security_Offences_(Special_Measures)_Act_2012) was unnecessary as the law was essential for addressing organized crime-related cases. He mentioned that Sosma allowed the court process to proceed. His statement drew brickbats from human rights organisations and politicians. On 16 February 2023, Saifuddin said Sosma will be strengthened as it is still relevant for maintaining national security. [Malaysians Against Death Penalty & Torture](/wiki/Malaysians_Against_Death_Penalty_%26_Torture) (Madpet) said that Saifuddin does not understand the rule of law and the administration of criminal justice; they also called for his resignation. ### Printing Presses and Publications Act In April 2023, several journalist groups have criticized Saifuddin for reversing Pakatan Harapan's pledge to review and repeal 'draconian Acts' such as the [Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984](/wiki/Printing_Presses_and_Publications_Act_1984). The Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ) executive director, Wathshlah Naidu, stated that Putrajaya's decision to retain the law appears to be a recurring practice among elected governments that backtrack on their election pledges for their own benefit. ### Swatch LGBT Issue In May 2023, swiss watchmaker Swatch has reported that Malaysian authorities seized 164 rainbow-colored watches from its Pride collection, with an estimated total value of US$14,000. The confiscation occurred during raids conducted on 13-14 May at eleven shopping malls across Malaysia, including outlets in the capital Kuala Lumpur. The watches were confiscated based on the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984, which is criticized by some as draconian and often utilized to prevent content that may offend or undermine race relations. The incident took place in a country where LGBT individuals face discrimination due to the illegality of homosexuality and the potential penalties of imprisonment and corporal punishment for sodomy, although enforcement is infrequent. The watches in question were described as having \"LGBT elements\" and were said to feature six colors, rather than the traditional seven colors of a rainbow. Swatch Group CEO Nick Hayek expressed disagreement, asserting that the watches, which carry a message of peace and love, should not be considered harmful. Despite the seizure, Swatch Malaysia's marketing manager, Sarah Kok, confirmed that they would continue replenishing stock and displaying the watches as instructed by the Swiss headquarters. The company expressed confusion over the enforcement unit's actions, wondering how they would handle the numerous natural rainbows that occur frequently in Malaysia's skies. On 10 August 2023, under the leadership of Saifuddin, the home ministry has banned all Swatch products that contain any elements related to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) individuals, whether on the watches themselves, their boxes, or wrappers. The ministry stated that this ban has been officially declared under the Printing Presses and Publications (Prohibition of Undesirable Publications) Order 2023, citing Swatch products as potentially \"prejudicial to morality.\" Individuals who possess such products from Swatch may face penalties of up to three years' imprisonment, a maximum fine of RM20,000, or both, if found guilty. ## Personal life Saifuddin Nasution is married to Norhayati Musa and shared 4 children. One of his son, Arham Rahimin Nasution Saifuddin Nasution, continued his studies in [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt) at a study center known as Ma'ahad Buuth Islamiyyah under the patronage of [Al-Azhar](/wiki/Al-Azhar_University). And now his son has continued his studies in [Cape Town](/wiki/Cape_Town), [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa) because of his ambition to follow in his father's footsteps as a politician. ## Election results [Kedah State Legislative Assembly](/wiki/Kedah_State_Legislative_Assembly) YearConstituencyCandidateVotesPctOpponent(s)VotesPctBallots castMajorityTurnout(/wiki/2000_Lunas_by-election)**N34 [Lunas](/wiki/Lunas_(state_constituency))****Saifuddin Nasution Ismail** ([**KeADILan**](/wiki/People%27s_Justice_Party_(Malaysia)))**10,511****50.66%**S.Anthonysamy ([MIC](/wiki/Malaysian_Indian_Congress))9,98148.10%20,74653077.58%N.Letchumanan ([IND](/wiki/Independent_politician))500.24%(/wiki/2004_Malaysian_state_elections)**N16 [Kubang Rotan](/wiki/Kubang_Rotan_(state_constituency))**Saifuddin Nasution Ismail ([PKR](/wiki/People%27s_Justice_Party_(Malaysia)))6,52731.09%**[Syed Razak Syed Zain Barakbah](/wiki/Syed_Razak_Syed_Zain_Barakbah)** ([**UMNO**](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation))**14,468****68.91%**21,4157,94178.36%[Penang State Legislative Assembly](/wiki/Penang_State_Legislative_Assembly) YearConstituencyCandidateVotesPctOpponent(s)VotesPctBallots castMajorityTurnout(/wiki/2018_Penang_state_election)**N36 [Pantai Jerejak](/wiki/Pantai_Jerejak_(state_constituency))****Saifuddin Nasution Ismail** ([**PKR**](/wiki/Keadilan))**14,014****73.50%**[Oh Tong Keong](/wiki/Oh_Tong_Keong) ([Gerakan](/wiki/Parti_Gerakan_Rakyat_Malaysia))3,29817.30%19,31510,71681.70%Mohd Farhan Yusri ([PAS](/wiki/Malaysian_Islamic_Party))1,6708.80%Yim Boon Leong ([MUP](/wiki/Malaysian_United_Party))970.40%[Parliament of Malaysia](/wiki/Dewan_Rakyat) YearConstituencyCandidateVotesPctOpponent(s)VotesPctBallots castMajorityTurnout(/wiki/1999_Malaysian_general_election)**P017 [Padang Serai](/wiki/Padang_Serai_(federal_constituency))**Saifuddin Nasution Ismail ([KeADILan](/wiki/People%27s_Justice_Party_(Malaysia)))18,02338.53%**Lim Bee Kau** ([**MCA**](/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese_Association))**27,395****58.56%**46,7789.37272.75%(/wiki/2004_Malaysian_general_election)Saifuddin Nasution Ismail ([PKR](/wiki/People%27s_Justice_Party_(Malaysia)))15,95337.78%**Lim Bee Kau** ([**MCA**](/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese_Association))**26,269****62.22%**43,30710,31680.31%(/wiki/2008_Malaysian_general_election)**P029 [Machang](/wiki/Machang_(federal_constituency))****Saifuddin Nasution Ismail** ([**PKR**](/wiki/People%27s_Justice_Party_(Malaysia)))**21,041****50.71%**Sazmi Miah ([UMNO](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation))19,58147.19%51,3721,46086.74%(/wiki/2013_Malaysian_general_election)**P018 [Kulim-Bandar Baharu](/wiki/Kulim-Bandar_Baharu)**Saifuddin Nasution Ismail ([PKR](/wiki/People%27s_Justice_Party_(Malaysia)))24,91147.42%**[Abd Aziz Sheikh Fadzir](/wiki/Abdul_Aziz_Sheikh_Fadzir)** ([**UMNO**](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation))**26,782****50.98%**52,7661,87186.63%(/wiki/2018_Malaysian_general_election)**Saifuddin Nasution Ismail** ([**PKR**](/wiki/People%27s_Justice_Party_(Malaysia)))**23,159****42.62%**[Abd Aziz Sheikh Fadzir](/wiki/Abdul_Aziz_Sheikh_Fadzir) ([UMNO](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation))18,29933.67%55,3904,86083.18%Hassan Abdul Razak ([PAS](/wiki/Malaysian_Islamic_Party))12,88523.71%(/wiki/2022_Malaysian_general_election)Saifuddin Nasution Ismail ([PKR](/wiki/People%27s_Justice_Party_(Malaysia)))21,40830.44%**[Roslan Hashim](/wiki/Roslan_Hashim)** ([**BERSATU**](/wiki/Malaysian_United_Indigenous_Party))**34,469****49.00%**71,61613,06179.40%Muhar Hussain ([UMNO](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation))13,87219.72%Mohd Yusrizal Yusuf ([PEJUANG](/wiki/Homeland_Fighter%27s_Party))5910.84% ## Honours ### Honours of Malaysia - [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) - Recipient of the [17th Yang di-Pertuan Agong Installation Medal](/wiki/Orders,_decorations,_and_medals_of_Malaysia#Honorary_orders_and_medals) (2024) - [Kedah](/wiki/Kedah) - Knight Companion of the [Order of Loyalty to the Royal House of Kedah](/wiki/Order_of_Loyalty_to_the_Royal_House_of_Kedah) (DSDK) – **Dato'** (2012) - Recipient of the Sultan Abdul Halim Golden Jubilee Medal (2008) - Recipient of the Sultan Sallehuddin Installation Medal (2018) - [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca) - Grand Commander of the [Exalted Order of Malacca](/wiki/Exalted_Order_of_Malacca#Grand_Commander) (DGSM) – **Datuk Seri** (2018) - [Sabah](/wiki/Sabah) - Grand Commander of the [Order of Kinabalu](/wiki/Order_of_Kinabalu) (SPDK) – **Datuk Seri Panglima** (2025) - [Members of the Malaysian Parliament who represented multiple states](/wiki/Members_of_the_Malaysian_Parliament_who_represented_multiple_states) - [List of people who have served in both Houses of the Malaysian Parliament](/wiki/List_of_people_who_have_served_in_both_Houses_of_the_Malaysian_Parliament) - Media related to Saifuddin Nasution Ismail at Wikimedia Commons - Saifuddin Nasution Ismail on [Facebook](/wiki/Facebook_(identifier)) Portals: - Malaysia - Biography - Politics\n",
