In March 2010, Ng mentioned that the weight of mother-tongue language examinations in the [Primary School Leaving Examination](/wiki/Primary_School_Leaving_Examination) (PSLE) might be reduced in order to benefit some students who are weak in their mother-tongue due to the emphasis on the English language in the Singapore education system. This sparked a debate among Singaporeans who support emphasis on mother-tongue languages in education. Ng subsequently assured Singaporeans that the weight of mother-tongue language in the PSLE would not be reduced. During the [2011 general election](/wiki/2011_Singaporean_general_election), Ng was part of a five-member PAP team contesting in [Bishan–Toa Payoh GRC](/wiki/Bishan%E2%80%93Toa_Payoh_GRC) and won 56.93% of the vote against the [Singapore People's Party](/wiki/Singapore_People%27s_Party).

On 4 November 2021, Ng described [Taiwan's political status](/wiki/Political_status_of_Taiwan) as an issue that for the People's Republic of China, \"goes to the heart of the political legitimacy of the leader, of the party of the party and it's a deep red line. I can think of no scenario which there are winners if there is an actual physical confrontation over Taiwan ... So, I would advise us to stay very far away from that.\" On 17 February 2025, at the [61st Munich Security Conference](/wiki/61st_Munich_Security_Conference), Ng stated that the Asian perspectives of the U.S. have shifted from being perceived as a force of \"moral legitimacy” to \"a landlord seeking rent.\" His remarks came following tensions between [President of the United States](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump) and other [NATO](/wiki/NATO) members over the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine).
