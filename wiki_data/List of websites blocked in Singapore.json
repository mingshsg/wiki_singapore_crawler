  "content": "This is a list of websites that are blocked in Singapore. These websites are mainly unlicensed gambling, pimping (known as vice related activities), copyright infringement/piracy, and for spreading falsehoods. Some websites may be blocked because they are suspected scam websites. Websites that are blocked in Singapore are easily circumvented by a [DNS](/wiki/DNS) change without the need to use a [VPN](/wiki/VPN). As of 2019, there were 202 vice-related websites blocked by Singaporean authorities. ## Table of blocked websites This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(May 2021)*Site nameDomain or URLType of siteReasonApplicable lawImplementation dateRef123Movies123movies.asIllegal streaming sitecopyright infringementCopyright ActSeptember 2022[Ashley Madison](/wiki/Ashley_Madison)ashleymadison.com[online dating service](/wiki/Online_dating_service)\"promotes and facilitates extramarital affairs\"November 2013[Asia Sentinel](/wiki/Asia_Sentinel)asiasentinel.comAmerica-based blog about Asia\"not complying with POFMA correction direction\"[POFMA](/wiki/POFMA)2 June 2023[Lawyers for Liberty](/wiki/Lawyers_for_Liberty)lawyersforliberty.orghuman rights NGO\"non-compliance\" with a correction direction issued against a statement on its website[POFMA](/wiki/POFMA)23 January 2020[The Pirate Bay](/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay)thepiratebay.orgBitTorrent index of digital contentcopyright infringing/piracyCopyright ActMay 2018[Playboy](/wiki/Playboy)playboy.comAmerican men's lifestyle and entertainment magazinenudity1996[Pornhub](/wiki/Pornhub)pornhub.com[pornography](/wiki/Pornography) video sharing siteBlocked due to pornographyMay 2016[Redtube](/wiki/Redtube)redtube.com[pornography](/wiki/Pornography) video sharing site\"symbolic statement\" of the country's societal valuesMay 2018SolarmovieSolarmovie.phBitTorrent index of digital contentcopyright infringing/piracyCopyright ActFebruary 2016SportsBaysportsbay.esIllegal streaming sitecopyright infringementCopyright ActSeptember 2022[States Times Review](/wiki/Alex_Tan)Socio-political websitedefamation of Singapore government[POFMA](/wiki/POFMA)November 2018[YouPorn](/wiki/YouPorn)youporn.com[pornography](/wiki/Pornography) video sharing site\"symbolic statement\" of the country's societal valuesMay 2018[KickassTorrents](/wiki/KickassTorrents)BitTorrent index of digital contentcopyright infringing/piracyCopyright ActMay 2018WatchSerieswatchseries.ninjaIllegal streaming sitecopyright infringementCopyright ActSeptember 2022Zao Bao Dailyzaobaodaily.cominauthentic news website\"potential hostile information threat\"Broadcasting ActOctober 2024Singapore Info Mapsingaporeinfomap.cominauthentic news website\"potential hostile information threat\"Broadcasting ActOctober 2024Singapore EraSingaporeera.cominauthentic news website\"potential hostile information threat\"Broadcasting ActOctober 2024Singapore Dao TimesSingdaotimes.cominauthentic news website\"potential hostile information threat\"Broadcasting ActOctober 2024Today in SingaporeTodayinsg.cominauthentic news website\"potential hostile information threat\"Broadcasting ActOctober 2024Lion City LifeLioncitylife.cominauthentic news website\"potential hostile information threat\"Broadcasting ActOctober 2024Singapura NowSingapuranow.cominauthentic news website\"potential hostile information threat\"Broadcasting ActOctober 2024Voice of Asia SingaporeVoasg.cominauthentic news website\"potential hostile information threat\"Broadcasting ActOctober 2024Singdao PRSingdaopr.cominauthentic news website\"potential hostile information threat\"Broadcasting ActOctober 2024Alamak.ioAlamak.ioinauthentic news website\"potential hostile information threat\"Broadcasting ActOctober 2024[GenderGP](/wiki/GenderGP)gendergp.comOnline gender clinicpublic health riskDecember 2024[Polymarket](/wiki/Polymarket)polymarket.comPredictive crypto gambling siteUnlawful gamblingGambling Control ActDecember 2024MalaysiaNowmalaysianow.comnews website\"non-compliance\" with a correction direction issued against a statement on its website[POFMA](/wiki/POFMA)November 2025 ## Media coverage On 1 March 2022, the Asia Video Industry Association's Coalition Against Piracy (CAP) announced that it had obtained a court order from the [Singapore High Court](/wiki/High_Court_of_Singapore) for the blocking of 30 illegal streaming sites and nearly 150 domain names associated with those sites.
