  "content": "Secondhand bookstore in Singapore The **Ana Book Store** is a [second-hand bookstore](/wiki/Used_bookstore) in stall 1, floor 5 of [Far East Plaza](/wiki/Far_East_Plaza), 14 [Scotts Road](/wiki/Scotts_Road), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). The store is owned by a 70-year-old [Bengali](/wiki/Bengalis) man named Mohammad Noorul Islam. It is the last second-hand bookstore in [Orchard Road](/wiki/Orchard_Road). The name, Ana, came from the owner's mother, Sultana. ## History The original store, known as the Modern Book Store, was founded in 1939 by M. Mohammad Aksir, who came from [East Pakistan](/wiki/East_Pakistan) (now [Bangladesh](/wiki/Bangladesh)) in 1938. He set up the store on [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore)’s [Bras Basah Road](/wiki/Bras_Basah_Road). In 1978, M. Mohammad Aksir and his father died, leaving Aksir's son, Mohammad Noorul Islam, to run the store. Noorul Islam later changed the bookstore's name to the Ana Book Store. In 1993, when the building housing the original shop was destroyed, the store was moved to [Far East Plaza](/wiki/Far_East_Plaza). Customers called Noorul Islam the \"[Mr Bean](/wiki/Mr._Bean_(character)) of Singapore\", something that local newspapers caught on to, providing more publicity for the shop.
