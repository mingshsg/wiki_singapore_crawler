'shrimp paste chicken'), is a [Singaporean](/wiki/Singaporean_cuisine) [fried chicken](/wiki/Fried_chicken) dish, consisting of fried chicken wings in a batter with fermented shrimp paste. ## Description Har cheong gai is regarded as one of the most popular family [fried chicken](/wiki/Fried_chicken) dishes in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), and is made with fermented [shrimp paste](/wiki/Shrimp_paste) (har cheong) and a host of other spices and ingredients. The shrimp paste used is not the darker Malaysian style paste used for [rojak](/wiki/Rojak) sauce, but the pinkish grey southeastern Chinese style. The recipe for har cheong gai differs from other fried chicken recipes in that the marinade and the [batter](/wiki/Batter_(cooking)) are not separate; rather wheat flour and potato or corn starch is added to the [marinade](/wiki/Marination), creating a seasoned batter. Depending on the recipe followed this is done at the very startor just prior to frying after the chicken has been allowed to marinate, in both cases the chicken is often allowed to marinate overnight, ## Har cheong gai burger A har cheong gai burger is a [chicken sandwich](/wiki/Chicken_sandwich) from [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It is made up of har cheong gai in a sesame seed bun with salad and [mayonnaise](/wiki/Mayonnaise). - [List of chicken dishes](/wiki/List_of_chicken_dishes) - [Taiwan fried chicken](/wiki/Taiwan_fried_chicken) - [Crispy fried chicken](/wiki/Crispy_fried_chicken) - [Ayam goreng](/wiki/Ayam_goreng) - [Chicken with chilies](/wiki/Chicken_with_chilies) - [Korean fried chicken](/wiki/Korean_fried_chicken)\n",
