The specific problem is: **Information needs to be condensed and some table columns need merging to make the details column more accessible.** Please help improve this article if you can. *(July 2025)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* The **National Monuments of Singapore**[a] are sites, buildings and structures in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) that have been designated by the [National Heritage Board](/wiki/National_Heritage_Board_(Singapore)) (NHB) as possessing exceptional historic, traditional, archaeological, architectural or artistic merit. These monuments are legally protected from demolition due to their cultural and historical significance, including associations with pivotal events such as the [Second World War](/wiki/World_War_II), the [independence of Singapore](/wiki/Independence_of_Singapore) and the nation's early development. The Preservation of Monuments Act empowers the NHB to oversee the preservation of these landmarks and encourages research as well as public engagement with Singapore's architectural heritage. The framework for designating national monuments was established under the Preservation of Monuments Act, enacted in December 1970. The act provided for the identification and legal protection of culturally significant sites, leading to the formation of the Preservation of Monuments Board (PMB) in April 1972. This body was tasked with enforcing the act amidst growing concern over the loss of heritage buildings due to rapid urban redevelopment. By mid-1973, forty sites were shortlisted for preservation and public suggestions were invited to expand the list. The initial batch of eight designated landmarks included the [Thong Chai Medical Institution](/wiki/Thong_Chai_Medical_Institution), [Armenian Church](/wiki/Armenian_Church,_Singapore), [St Andrew's Cathedral](/wiki/St_Andrew%27s_Cathedral,_Singapore), [Telok Ayer Market](/wiki/Telok_Ayer_Market), [Thian Hock Keng Temple](/wiki/Thian_Hock_Keng_Temple), [Sri Mariamman Temple](/wiki/Sri_Mariamman_Temple,_Singapore), [Fatimah Mosque](/wiki/Masjid_Hajjah_Fatimah) and the [Cathedral of the Good Shepherd](/wiki/Cathedral_of_the_Good_Shepherd). In 2021, amendments were proposed to expand the act's definition to include open spaces, inland waters and any land area associated with human activity, both past and present. The NHB, a [statutory board](/wiki/Statutory_boards_of_the_Singapore_Government) under the [Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth](/wiki/Ministry_of_Culture,_Community_and_Youth) within the [Government of Singapore](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore), is responsible for gazetting and maintaining national monuments. As of date, 83 structures have been gazetted of which 77 are formally recognised as national monuments. These include religious sites, civic buildings, marketplaces and other culturally significant landmarks across the island. The most recent addition to the list is the [38 Oxley Road](/wiki/38_Oxley_Road), officially gazetted on 12 December 2025. A comprehensive and regularly updated list of these monuments is accessible via the NHB's heritage portal. ## List of national monuments Building nameDate completedImageUsage as of 2025DetailsLocation[b]Entry number and date gazetted[c]Ref(s)[38 Oxley Road](/wiki/38_Oxley_Road)1898HouseAn eight bedroom two storey bungalow near [Orchard Road](/wiki/Orchard_Road). [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) and his family moved into the residence after [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II), with his wife [Kwa Geok Choo](/wiki/Kwa_Geok_Choo) taking up residence there in 1950. Meetings of the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) were regularly held in the basement in 1954. The building continued to serve as Lee's home throughout his tenure as [prime minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore), and his first born son, the third prime minister of Singapore [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong), was raised there. Following Singapore's [separation from Malaysia](/wiki/Independence_of_Singapore_Agreement_1965) in 1965, fortifications and a guardhouse were added. Prior to Lee Kuan Yew's death in 2015, he expressed his intention for the house to be demolished, a position later shared by his daughter, [Lee Wei Ling](/wiki/Lee_Wei_Ling), who died in 2024, as well as his other son, [Lee Hsien Yang](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Yang). However, the government opposed the plan and subsequently gazetted it as a national monument in 2025. It remains undetermined as to which parts of the house would be demolished or retained since its elevation into a national monument. Any sort of demolition will make it the second after the [Cathay Building](/wiki/Cathay_Building) to have parts of its structure demolished.[Orchard](/wiki/Orchard)7712 December 2025[Anderson Bridge](/wiki/Anderson_Bridge_(Singapore))1910[Bridge](/wiki/Bridge)Opened in 1910, the steel [truss girder](/wiki/Truss_girder) bridge spans 204 feet (62 m) and was constructed to ease traffic on the [Cavenagh Bridge](/wiki/Cavenagh_Bridge).
