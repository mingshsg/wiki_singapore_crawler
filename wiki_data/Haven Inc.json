  "content": "Logistics company **Haven Inc.** is a company that automates [logistics](/wiki/Logistics) for [ocean freight](/wiki/Maritime_transport) companies. Based in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco) and [Basel](/wiki/Basel), it manages a [freight rate](/wiki/Freight_rate) and logistics for large international [supply chains](/wiki/Supply_chain). Haven is considered one of the pioneers of the digital revolution in shipping logistics. ## History Matt Tillman, a serial tech [entrepreneur](/wiki/Entrepreneur), had the idea for a freight and logistics platform in 2014, when he tried to book space on a [container vessel](/wiki/Container_ship) to ship a truck. He created a [reverse auction](/wiki/Reverse_auction) over [email](/wiki/Email), treating all [freight forwarders](/wiki/Freight_forwarder) the same, and realized that the process could be automated. Tillman met with Jeff Wehner, who had worked in supply chain at [Apple](/wiki/Apple_Inc.) and [Nest](/wiki/Nest_Labs). They concluded that the traditional carrier-forwarder-shipper procurement structure was not the best model for shippers in terms of price discovery and booking. Together with [Renee DiResta](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e_DiResta), they founded Haven Inc. ## Acquisition FourKites®, a supply chain visibility platform, announced in April 2021 its acquisition of Haven, Inc., and introduction of Dynamic Ocean, a next-generation visibility solution that redefines end-to-end management for international ocean shipments. - Official website - Local Moving\n",
