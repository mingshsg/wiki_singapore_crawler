  "content": "Defunct residence in Singapore **Coleman House** was a former residence of [George Drumgoole Coleman](/wiki/George_Drumgoole_Coleman), an [Irish](/wiki/Ireland) [architect](/wiki/Architect) and the Singapore's First Superintendent of Public Works. Construction started in 1823. The building was demolished in December 1965 to make way for the Peninsula Hotel in 1971. ## History The house was built by Coleman in 1829, with three large bedrooms and a total area of 14,500 square feet (1,350 m2). Following Coleman's departure of Singapore due to an illness, the building was leased off to French hotelier [Gaston Dutronquoy](/wiki/Gaston_Dutronquoy), who relocated the London Hotel to the house, and turned the dining room in to the Theatre Royal. The hotel was frequented by [Joseph Conrad](/wiki/Joseph_Conrad) during his visits to Singapore. The building was turned into the [Hotel de la Paix](/wiki/Hotel_de_la_Paix) in 1856, and became the personal residence of [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_people) businessman [Tan Hiok Nee](/wiki/Tan_Hiok_Nee) in the 1880s. The house was later converted into the Burlington Hotel, and served as a hotel or boarding house during World War II. The house was later leased off to shopkeepers who lived upstairs. The Singapore government offered to buy the house in 1955 for redevelopment. The building was demolished in 1965, with over a thousand squatters occupying the building prior to its demolition, and was replaced by the Peninsula Hotel and Shopping Centre.
