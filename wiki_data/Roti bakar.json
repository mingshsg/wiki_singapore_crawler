  "content": "Toast in Malay and Indonesian [Toast](/wiki/Toast_(food)) is a popular breakfast food as well as [tea time snack](/wiki/Tea_(meal)) in countries like [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) known as ****roti bakar**** or ***roti kahwin***. It uses [white bread](/wiki/White_bread) grilled or toasted over [charcoal](/wiki/Charcoal), though this practice has dwindled with the advent of [sandwich presses](/wiki/Sandwich_press).[*page needed*] Common spreads for *roti bakar* include [sugar](/wiki/Sugar), [margarine](/wiki/Margarine), [butter](/wiki/Butter), [cheese](/wiki/Cheese), [peanut butter](/wiki/Peanut_butter), [chocolate spread](/wiki/Chocolate_spread) and [kaya](/wiki/Coconut_jam). ## Variants ### Indonesia In Indonesia, *roti bakar* is usually prepared as a sandwich of grilled white bread with a filling, consumed both as a light breakfast and a common street food. It was developed during the era of [Dutch colonial rule](/wiki/Dutch_Indies) as a practical way to consume day-old bread; it was typically served with [butter](/wiki/Butter), [condensed milk](/wiki/Condensed_milk), or [Dutch cheeses](/wiki/Dutch_cheese). After [Indonesian independence](/wiki/Indonesian_independence), *roti bakar* became ubiquitous throughout Indonesia, as consumption of toast became a matter of taste rather than frugality. Many flavors have been developed for modern tastes, such as *[hagelslag](/wiki/Sprinkles)*, crushed [Oreo](/wiki/Oreo) biscuits, or chocolate syrup.[*page needed*] ### Malaysia and Singapore In Malaysia, coconut jam and cold butter are a popular combination to spread on *roti bakar*. This may be the inspiration for the Singaporean [kaya toast](/wiki/Kaya_toast) which was created by Hainanese immigrants.[*page needed*] The city of [Ipoh](/wiki/Ipoh) in [Perak](/wiki/Perak) is known for its [kopitiam](/wiki/Kopitiam) establishments, where *roti bakar* accompanied with local tea or [coffee beverages](/wiki/Ipoh_white_coffee) and a serving of half boiled eggs is a staple order during morning or afternoon tea. A variation on *roti bakar* is *roti titab*, a thick warm toast with kaya spread onto all four corners and topped with a half-boiled egg.[*page needed*] - Food portal - Indonesia portal - Malaysia portal - Singapore portal - [Kaya toast](/wiki/Kaya_toast) – Malaysian and Singaporean toast\n",
