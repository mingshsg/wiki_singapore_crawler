Please introduce links to this page from related articles. *(December 2025)* The **SMA House**, formerly known as the **Malayan Motors Showroom**, is a former Malayan Motors car [showroom](/wiki/Showroom) on [Orchard Road](/wiki/Orchard_Road). In 1987, the Singapore Manufacturer's Association moved into the building, followed by the [Management Development Institute of Singapore](/wiki/Management_Development_Institute_of_Singapore) in 2002. ## History The building was built by Wearne Brothers as a Malayan Motors showroom in 1925. It served as a car showroom until 1980. In 1986, [Goldman Sachs](/wiki/Goldman_Sachs) held a party in the building. In 1987, the Singapore Manufacturers' Association moved into the building, which was renamed the SMA House. The association renovated the building for $450,000 and introduced a library, offices, a conference room, and a showroom which showcased made-in-Singapore products. It was officially reopened on 9 March 1988. However, by May, the building had lost two-thirds of its exhibitors due to the high rental price for the display of products. In 2000, the building was gazetted for conservation. The [Management Development Institute of Singapore](/wiki/Management_Development_Institute_of_Singapore) moved into the building in 2002. The building has been included on the Orchard Heritage Trail by the [National Heritage Board](/wiki/National_Heritage_Board_(Singapore)). 1°17′56″N 103°50′39″E﻿ / ﻿1.2989°N 103.8441°E﻿ / 1.2989; 103.8441\n",
