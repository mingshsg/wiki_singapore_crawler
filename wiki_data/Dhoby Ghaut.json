  "content": "Subzone of Museum Planning Area in Singapore **Dhoby Ghaut** ([IPA](/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): /ˌdoʊbi ˈɡɔːt/ *DOH-bee GAWT*) is a place in Singapore that often refers to the [MRT station of the same name](/wiki/Dhoby_Ghaut_MRT_station), which is a major interchange station on Singapore's [Mass Rapid Transit](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) network connecting the [North-South Line](/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_Line_(Singapore)), [North East Line](/wiki/North_East_Line), and the [Circle Line](/wiki/Circle_Line_(Singapore)). As a place, Dhoby Ghaut lies along the eastern end of [Orchard Road](/wiki/Orchard_Road). There is a shopping mall above the MRT station called [Plaza Singapura](/wiki/Plaza_Singapura). ## Etymology Dhoby Ghaut was influenced from *[Dhobi Ghat](/wiki/Dhobi_ghat)*, which literally means *washerman's place* in [Hindi](/wiki/Hindi), from *[dhobi](/wiki/Dhobi)*, \"washerman\" or one that does [laundry](/wiki/Laundry), and *[ghat](/wiki/Ghat)*, referring to a series of steps leading down to a body of water, as in the case of the [Varanasi ghats](/wiki/Ghats_in_Varanasi) by the [Ganges](/wiki/Ganges). The Hindi term *ghat* passed into English usage during the [British occupation of India](/wiki/British_Raj), and was later [anglicised](/wiki/Anglicisation) to *[ghaut](/wiki/Ghat)*. Around this time, the British had also ruled Singapore, which influenced the naming of this area. ## Early history Until the early 1900s, the *dhobis* used water from a clear stream that flowed into *Sungai Bras Basah*, now Stamford Canal. This stream now exists as a large drain beside Handy Road. The *ghats*, or steps leading down to the stream, were demolished when *Sungai Bras Basah* was canalised. The *dhobis* would then dry the laundry at Dhoby Green, the open park bounded by Stamford Road, Handy Road, Bras Basah Road and Prinsep Street. - [Dhoby Ghaut, Penang](/wiki/Dhoby_Ghaut,_Penang), Malaysia - [Dhobi Ghat](/wiki/Dhobi_Ghat), Mumbai, India - Reference from National Library of Singapore Infopedia Website This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
