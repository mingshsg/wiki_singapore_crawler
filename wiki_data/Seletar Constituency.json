  "content": "* *Seletar Constituency** was a single-member constituency of the [Legislative Council](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_Singapore) and [Legislative Assembly of Singapore](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore) between 1951 and 1959. It covered the [Seletar](/wiki/Seletar) area in [North-East Region](/wiki/North-East_Region,_Singapore). In 1951, the constituency was formed from [Rural East](/wiki/Rural_East_Constituency) and [Rural West constituencies](/wiki/Rural_West_Constituency). The 1952 Seletar by-election remains the only occasion on which a candidate not from the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) won unopposed. In 1955, parts of the constituency were separated to form [Bukit Panjang](/wiki/Bukit_Panjang_Constituency), [Sembawang](/wiki/Sembawang_Constituency) and [Serangoon constituencies](/wiki/Serangoon_Constituency). In 1959, the constituency was abolished and split into [Jalan Kayu](/wiki/Jalan_Kayu_Constituency), [Nee Soon](/wiki/Nee_Soon_Constituency), [Serangoon Gardens](/wiki/Serangoon_Gardens_Constituency) and [Thomson constituencies](/wiki/Thomson_Constituency). ## Member of Parliament YearMember of ParliamentParty[Legislative Council of Singapore](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_Singapore)**1951**[Vilasini Menon](/wiki/Vilasini_Menon)Independent**1952**Madai Puthan Damodaran NairIndependent[Legislative Assembly of Singapore](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore)[**1955**](/wiki/1955_Singaporean_general_election)Madai Puthan Damodaran NairIndependent ## Election results ### Electoral results in the 1950s [General Election 1951](/wiki/1951_Singaporean_general_election): Seletar PartyCandidateVotes%±%[Independent](/wiki/Independent_politician)Vilasini Menon1,46742.7[Labour Party](/wiki/Labour_Party_(Singapore))Gopalan Nair Nanupillai1,04330.3[PP](/wiki/Progressive_Party_(Singapore))V.
