  "content": "Historic site in Telok Ayer Street **Ying Fo Fui Kun** ([simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 应和会馆; [traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 應和會館; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *Yìnghè Huìguǎn*) is a [Hakka](/wiki/Hakka_people) [clan](/wiki/Clan) [association](/wiki/Voluntary_association) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). Its clan house is located at [Telok Ayer Street](/wiki/Telok_Ayer_Street) in the [Outram Planning Area](/wiki/Outram,_Singapore), within the [Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore). The Ying Fo Fui Kun clan house building was constructed in 1881-1882. Ying Fo Fui Kun was the first Hakka association in Singapore and once housed the Ying Sin School (應新學校) from 1905 to 1971. ## History Established in 1822-1823, Ying Fo Fui Kun is the oldest clan associations in Singapore. At a time when development in Singapore was in its infancy, Ying Fo Fui Kun's clan house was amongst the first buildings in [Telok Ayer](/wiki/Telok_Ayer), where the island's earliest [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_people) [settlements](/wiki/Urban-type_settlement) were located. Ying Fo Fui Kun began life as a [temple](/wiki/Temple), serving the needs of Hakka immigrants from Jia Ying [prefecture](/wiki/Prefecture) in [Canton](/wiki/Guangzhou). Its [founder](/wiki/Entrepreneur), Liu Runde (劉潤德), envisaged Ying Fo Fui Kun as a public institution that would not only provide [welfare](/wiki/Social_welfare_provision) services — the conventional role of a clan association — but also act as a [kinship](/wiki/Kinship) bridge between the Hakka community in Singapore and [China](/wiki/China). Ying Fo Fui Kun looked after the welfare of its members, finding [accommodation](/wiki/Lodging) and jobs for newly arrived Hakkas and making [funeral](/wiki/Funeral) arrangements for deceased clan members. In 1905, Ying Fo Fui Kun opened what was then considered a modern [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language) [school](/wiki/School). In 1887, the Ying Fo Fui Kun bought over a piece of land from the British government to meet the burial demands of the increasing number of association members. The Ying Fo Kuan Memorial was built, and an ancestral hall was built next to it, which was called the Shuang Long Shan Wu Shu Ancestral Hall (Twin Dragon Hills). ## Architecture Ying Fo Fui Kun's clan house has since been rebuilt several times, but it has always remained at its original site in Telok Ayer. The clan house features [inscribed](/wiki/Inscription) [stone](/wiki/Rock_(geology)) [tablets](/wiki/Clay_tablet) and [carved](/wiki/Wood_carving) boards from the nineteenth century. The clan's oldest surviving [artefact](/wiki/Cultural_artifact) is an 1846 inscribed board. On the ground floor are [meeting](/wiki/Meeting) and [administration](/wiki/Business_administration) rooms, while the upper level houses an [altar](/wiki/Altar) dedicated to *[Guan Ti](/wiki/Guan_Yu)* (关帝), the Martial deity honored by Qing imperial court. A popular [Chinese heroic deity](/wiki/Shen_(Chinese_religion)) revered by many clan associations, *Guan Ti* embodies the qualities of [courage](/wiki/Courage) and [loyalty](/wiki/Loyalty) — two [virtues](/wiki/Virtue) close to the hearts of the early Chinese immigrants. The clan building has been well [preserved](/wiki/Historic_preservation); a 1997 [renovation](/wiki/Renovation) [restored](/wiki/Building_restoration) the intricate [beam](/wiki/Beam_(structure)) carvings to their original splendour. The Ying Fo Fui Kun clan house was gazetted as a [national monument](/wiki/National_Monuments_of_Singapore) on 18 December 1998. - National Heritage Board (2002), *Singapore's 100 Historic Places*, Archipelago Press, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-4068-23-3 - Preservation of Monuments Board, *Know Our Monuments* - Ying Fo Fui Kun - Ying Fo Fui Kun write up by CHinatownology\n",
