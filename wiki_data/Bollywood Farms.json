  "content": "* *Bollywood Farms Pte Ltd**, formerly known as **Bollywood Veggies Organic Farm**, is a farming collective and organic growing education center located in the [Lim Chu Kang](/wiki/Lim_Chu_Kang) district of North West Singapore. ## Background The center was launched in 2000 by [Ivy Singh-Lim](/wiki/Ivy_Singh-Lim) and her husband, former [NTUC FairPrice](/wiki/NTUC_FairPrice) [chief executive](/wiki/Chief_executive), Lim Ho Seng, as a project to run after they had both retired from their previous careers. [Neil Humphreys](/wiki/Neil_Humphreys) covered the center in his 2006 book *Final Notes From a Great Island*. In 2010 *Bollywood Veggies* was charged with failing to have its buildings inspected by a structural engineer or hold the inspections after several requests that they do so. Singh-Lim and Lim stated that they did not own the buildings on the center's property (as they were leasing the land ) and that they had not received any prior notices about the requested inspections, to which the courts stated that they were the legal owners of the buildings. They were later cleared of the charges on 25 March 2011, after a judge ruled that it could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that *Bollywood Veggies* had received the notices. In 2021, *Bollywood Veggies* was rebranded as **Bollywood Farms**. - Official website\n",
