  "content": "Singaporean businessman (1816–1873) **Abraham Logan** (13 August 1816 – 20 December 1873) was the owner and editor of the *[Singapore Free Press](/wiki/Singapore_Free_Press)*. Also a prominent lawyer, having studied law in [Edinburgh](/wiki/Edinburgh), Logan played a significant role in the historic transferral of the Straits Settlement to the Colonial Office. His father being Thomas Logan, Abraham Logan was born in [Hutton Hall](/wiki/Hutton_Castle), Berwickshire, Scotland. Secretary to the Singapore Chamber of Commerce from 1850, until his retirement in 1868, Logan was pivotal in the changing of hands of the Straits Settlement. On 1 April 1867, the transfer was finally made, with a bit of help from allies in London. Living most of his life on Pleasant Mountain, Thomson Road, Logan later moved to [Penang](/wiki/Penang) in 1869, after the death of his brother, [James Richardson Logan](/wiki/James_Richardson_Logan). Resigning from most of his activities in Singapore, Logan died in Penang on 20 December 1873. This Singaporean biographical article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it. - v - t - e\n",
