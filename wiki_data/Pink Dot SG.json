Attendees of Pink Dot events gather to form a \"pink dot\" to show support for inclusiveness, diversity and the freedom to love in the country. Pink Dot events typically include concert performances and booths sponsored by organizations that support the LGBTQ community and cause in addition to the event's name-brand formation. The success of Pink Dot in Singapore has inspired similar events in several other countries, leading to the event to become known as Pink Dot SG — SG being an [initialism](/wiki/Acronym#Nomenclature) for Singapore. It has been held each year in Singapore from 2009 to 2019 at the [Speakers' Corner](/wiki/Speakers%27_Corner,_Singapore) in [Hong Lim Park](/wiki/Hong_Lim_Park) on a Saturday in the months of May, June or July. The 2020 and 2021 editions were held as online livestreams, in view of the global [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). The 2022 edition and subsequent editions were held in-person once again. ## History In September 2008, the rules governing activities conducted at Singapore's [Speakers' Corner](/wiki/Speakers%27_Corner,_Singapore) at [Hong Lim Park](/wiki/Hong_Lim_Park) were relaxed, allowing demonstrations organised by Singaporeans to be held at the park, providing that all participants are either citizens or permanent residents. This allowed the first Pink Dot SG event to take place at the Speakers' Corner on 16 May 2009. A total of sixteen Pink Dot events have been held in Singapore, occurring annually on Saturdays in May, June or July. Many organisations around the world modeled LGBTQ events after the Pink Dot concept, often borrowing the \"Pink Dot\" prefix. For distinction, the Singapore events became known as Pink Dot SG. The design of the Pink Dot SG mascot \"Pinkie\", a personification of the pink dot, was provided by graphic designer Soh Ee Shaun. ## Events Each event from 2009 to 2019 took place on a Saturday at Speakers' Corner in Hong Lim Park with the exception of the 2020 and 2021 editions where it was held online due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2022, events were held in-person once again. ### Pink Dot SG 2009 Pink Dot SG 2009 was held on 16 May, launched with a campaign video titled \"RED + WHITE = PINK\". It was Singapore's first public, open-air, pro-LGBTQ event and established the record at the time for the greatest turnout for a gathering at [Speakers' Corner](/wiki/Speakers%27_Corner,_Singapore) in Hong Lim Park since the venue's inception. The event was deemed a milestone for Singapore's LGBTQ community. Ambassadors of the event were local celebrities: actor [Timothy Nga](/wiki/Timothy_Nga), actress [Neo Swee Lin](/wiki/Neo_Swee_Lin) and radio DJ Rosalyn Lee. During the event, formations of the words \"LOVE\" and \"4All\" were created by participants. The event concluded with the formation of the titular Pink Dot. The pioneer Pink Dot SG event was given extensive coverage in both international and local media. Locally, *[The Straits Times](/wiki/The_Straits_Times)* and [*TODAY*](/wiki/Today_(Singapore_newspaper)) newspapers covered the event. However, reports regarding the number of attendees were inconsistent. Organisers estimated an attendance of 2,500, while *The Straits Times* reported a turnout of 1,000, and *TODAY* reported \"at least 500\". Internationally, the event was covered by the [BBC](/wiki/BBC) and the *[New York Times](/wiki/New_York_Times)*, with reports syndicated to publications around the world through wire services the [Associated Press](/wiki/Associated_Press) and [Agence France-Presse](/wiki/Agence_France-Presse). ### Pink Dot SG 2010 Pink Dot SG 2010 was held on 15 May, with the theme: \"Focusing on Our Families\". There was a turnout of 4,000 participants and the event received local media coverage by [Channel News Asia](/wiki/Channel_News_Asia) and *The Sunday Times*. The event was also reported internationally by the [BBC](/wiki/BBC), the [Associated Press](/wiki/Associated_Press), [Reuters](/wiki/Reuters) and [Agence France-Presse](/wiki/Agence_France-Presse). Ambassadors of the event were local celebrities: actor [Adrian Pang](/wiki/Adrian_Pang), actress [Tan Kheng Hua](/wiki/Tan_Kheng_Hua) and DJ Bigkid. ### Pink Dot SG 2011 Pink Dot SG 2011 was held on 18 June with more than 10,000 participants. The event featured the theme song \"[I Want To Hold Your Hand](/wiki/I_Want_To_Hold_Your_Hand)\" by [the Beatles](/wiki/The_Beatles) and a campaign video by [Boo Junfeng](/wiki/Boo_Junfeng). The event had attracted [Google](/wiki/Google) as a corporate sponsor, and the multinational company continued to support the event in subsequent years. Local musical cabaret trio the [Dim Sum Dollies](/wiki/Dim_Sum_Dollies) made an appearance as the official ambassadors of the event. Pink Dot SG 2011 was covered widely by local and international mainstream media. An aerial shot of Pink Dot SG was featured on [xinmsn](/wiki/Xinmsn) news for June's \"2011 Year in Pictures\". This was also the first time Pink Dot SG was featured in \"Time Out Singapore\" with a full article devoted to it. The event was also promoted in an article on [CNNGo](/wiki/CNNGo). International Pink Dot events were held the same day in Anchorage, Alaska; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and London, England. ### Pink Dot SG 2012 Pink Dot SG 2012 was held on 30 June and had the campaign theme \"Someday\" and the theme song \"[True Colors](/wiki/True_Colors_(Cyndi_Lauper_song))\". At this event, 15,000 participants formed a glowing pink dot with mobile phones, torches and flashlights. The event added [Barclays](/wiki/Barclays) as an official corporate supporter, alongside Google. Celebrity ambassadors were former actress [Sharon Au](/wiki/Sharon_Au), actor Lim Yu-Beng and drag queen actor-comedian [Kumar](/wiki/Kumar_(drag_queen)). Pink Dot SG 2012 was widely reported in the mainstream media and by international media agencies, including *[The Wall Street Journal](/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal)*, Taiwan's lihpao, Thailand's PBS, and Egypt's bikyamasr. Singer [Jason Mraz](/wiki/Jason_Mraz), who was giving a performance on 29 June in Singapore, made a shout-out in a video in support of Pink Dot 2012, prior to the event. The 2012 event inspired the launch of Pink Dot Okinawa, which had its first event the following year. ### Pink Dot SG 2013 Pink Dot 2013 was held the evening of 29 June. The event marked its fifth year under a campaign of \"Home\", the title of a local [National Day](/wiki/National_Day_(Singapore)) song which doubled as the event's theme song. The campaign featured a video, directed by local filmmaker [Boo Junfeng](/wiki/Boo_Junfeng), depicting three individual true-life experiences. Like the previous year, the event included the formation of the Pink Dot with pink lights. Pink Dot organisers claimed a record turnout of 21,000, which would make it the largest civil society gathering in the country. To accommodate the large number of participants, a second \"satellite\" focal point was created to channel traffic away from the busiest areas. Prior to the formation of the Pink Dot, participants were treated to a range of activities by more than 20 community groups and partners. Pink Dot SG 2013's list of corporate contributors grew to include global financial firm [JPMorgan Chase](/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase), local hotel [Parkroyal on Pickering](/wiki/Parkroyal_on_Pickering), contact lens specialist [CooperVision](/wiki/The_Cooper_Companies) and audio branding agency The Gunnery, in addition to Google and Barclays. Local actress [Michelle Chia](/wiki/Michelle_Chia), theatre company [W!LD RICE](/wiki/W!LD_RICE), artistic director [Ivan Heng](/wiki/Ivan_Heng) and sportscaster Mark Richmond were the event's ambassadors. The event was covered by local and international media, including Indonesia-based Asia Calling, *[The Economist](/wiki/The_Economist)*, the [BBC](/wiki/BBC), *[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian)* and [Reuters](/wiki/Reuters). The event was also featured in the YouTube-sponsored video \"Proud to Love\", a compilation of video clips supporting the LGBTQ community, equal rights and marriage equality. Additionally, before the event, the band [Fun](/wiki/Fun_(band)) made a shout-out in a video in support of Pink Dot 2013. ### Pink Dot SG 2014\n",
