At the size of 7.1 hectares, the defunct waterpark is the biggest waterpark known to exist in Singapore long even after its closure. ## Background Opened on 8 December 1994 at a cost of S$54 million, the 7.1 hectares waterpark had an 8-lane giant slide and a number of other high-speed water slides and other features. ### Attractions There were about 16 different water rides at waterpark, notably: - Medusa - Double Trouble - Gang of Four - Black Hole - Flashflood - Wild wild wet ## Decline and closure However, its popularity waned over time due to its high entrance fees and its inaccessibility.
