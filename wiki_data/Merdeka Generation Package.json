The MGP is a spinoff from the [Pioneer Generation Package](/wiki/Pioneer_Generation_Package) which benefitted the pioneering generation of [Singaporeans](/wiki/Singaporeans). \"Merdeka\" signifies the years that [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) had worked towards colonial self governance, independence and sovereignty. The Merdeka Generation (MG) had contributed to Singapore's progress from a developing to a [developed country](/wiki/Developed_country) and the challenging times such as major financial crisis, [September 11 attacks](/wiki/September_11_attacks), and the [SARS outbreak](/wiki/2002%E2%80%932004_SARS_outbreak) in Singapore. ## Eligibility To be eligible for the MGP, one must be a Singaporean born in the 1950s. Additionally, the package will extended to those born in 1949 or earlier and who obtained Singaporean citizenship by 1996, who had missed out on the [Pioneer Generation Package](/wiki/Pioneer_Generation_Package). ## Benefits ### Medisave 5-years Top-up Under MGP, people receive a MediSave top-up of S$200 annually for five years, on top of GST Voucher-MediSave top-ups. ### MediShield Life Higher Subsidy Merdeka generation seniors, receive lifelong subsidies on their MediShield Life premiums.
