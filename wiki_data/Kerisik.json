  "content": "Traditional Malay condiment ***Kerisik*** ([Jawi](/wiki/Jawi_script): كريسيق), also known as ***ambu-ambu*** in [Minangkabau](/wiki/Minangkabau_language) and ***kelapa gongseng*** in [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_language), is a condiment or spice made from grinding toasted and [grated](/wiki/Grating) [coconut](/wiki/Coconut) used in cooking among the [Malay](/wiki/Malays_(ethnic_group)) and [Minangkabau](/wiki/Minangkabau_people) communities of [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysian_cuisine) and [Singapore](/wiki/Singaporean_cuisine). It is sometimes referred to as coconut butter. It can be made at home as a byproduct of extracting [coconut milk](/wiki/Coconut_milk) or bought ready made. *Kerisik* is used in dishes such as *kerabu* salads, *[nasi ulam](/wiki/Nasi_ulam)*, *[gulai](/wiki/Gulai)* and especially *[rendang](/wiki/Rendang)* as a gravy thickener. Kerisik means \"dry\" in [Malaysian](/wiki/Malaysian_language) in the sense of dry leaves or grated coconut. Fresh *kerisik* can be easily made from fresh coconut which is grated and sautéed on low heat, then ground in a mortar and pestle. Dried grated coconut can also be used, however, the resulting paste is not as fragrant. Pre-made *kerisik* can develop an unpleasant smell. It is not easily found outside [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), and will most likely only be found in Asian specialty food shops outside of these countries. ## Grading *Kerisik* is divided into grade 'A', for *kerisik* that is fragrant and creamy, tastes sweet and has a nutty aftertaste, and grade 'B', which tends to have fewer of the fragrant notes which are the key point in choosing a good *kerisik*. As for the last grade, grade 'C', manufacturers tend to use coconut leftovers from the production of coconut milk. This leaves the kerisik with only the nutty taste and with a bland and husky aftertaste. This 'C' grade kerisik floods the market, confusing customers. - Food portal - Indonesia portal - Malaysia portal - Singapore portal - [Malay cuisine](/wiki/Malay_cuisine) - [Serundeng](/wiki/Serundeng) - How to toast coconut and make kerisik at pickles-and-spices.com\n",
