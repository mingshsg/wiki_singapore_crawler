  "content": "Green, yellow and red flag A [tricolour](/wiki/Tricolor_(flag)) featuring [green](/wiki/Green), [yellow](/wiki/Yellow) and [red](/wiki/Red), is a combination of colours that commonly found in varying designs of symbols adopted by some major organisations to symbolise the [Malay people](/wiki/Malay_people). ## Symbolism The tricolour is derived from the three important values of [Malayness](/wiki/Malayness); [Islam](/wiki/Islam), [Malay rulers](/wiki/Malay_rulers) and [Malay culture](/wiki/Malay_culture). The green is the [traditional colour of Islam](/wiki/Green_in_Islam), a faith that has been the integral part of Malay culture. The yellow is the royal colour commonly associated with Malay [sultans](/wiki/Sultan), and used to allude the allegiance of Malay people to their [Rulers](/wiki/Malay_rulers). The third colour, red, is the traditional colour in Malay culture, used to denote the courage, bravery, heroism and loyalty. The shade of red nicknamed *kesumba* red that is identical to [scarlet](/wiki/Scarlet_(color)) and commonly associated with blood, is the existential colour of the Malays and is the most frequently cited colour in the literature. The oldest Malay state, [Kedah](/wiki/Kedah), also adopted the red as its traditional colour. ## Usage Despite having deep roots in Malay traditions, the green, yellow and red as a collective symbolism only surfaced in 1933, when the [Royal Malay Regiment](/wiki/Royal_Malay_Regiment) was founded. Both the regimental crest and flag bear the tricolour, as soldiers of the regiment swore their allegiance to the Sultans of [Malay states](/wiki/Monarchies_of_Malaysia), then the [protectorates](/wiki/Protectorate) of the [British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire). In 1946, when [Malay nationalist](/wiki/Malay_nationalism) movement at its peak, the [right wing](/wiki/Right-wing_politics) [United Malays National Organisation](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation) (UMNO) adopted the [tricolour](/wiki/Sang_Saka_Malaya#Sang_Saka_Bangsa) in its flag. The party, which would lead [Malaya](/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya) to its independence and govern the nation until 2018, included the additional white band to its flag to symbolise purity After UMNO, the tricolour also appears in the symbols of other right wing organisations like Pekida and [Perkasa](/wiki/Perkasa), and some major [Silat](/wiki/Silat_Melayu) associations in Malaysia, including [Seni Gayong](/wiki/Seni_Gayong) and [Seni Gayung Fatani](/wiki/Seni_Gayung_Fatani). The tricolour also gained popularity among those in the [gang population](/wiki/Gang_population). One of the notorious criminal [gangs](/wiki/Gang) outlawed by the Malaysian government, the *Tiga Line* ('the three lines'), established its identity based on the tricolour. Across the [Straits of Malacca](/wiki/Straits_of_Malacca) in [Riau](/wiki/Riau) and [Riau Islands](/wiki/Riau_Islands) in [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra) where the [Indonesian Malays](/wiki/Malay_Indonesian) having a strong historical and cultural ties with the Malay Peninsula, the colours hold a philosophical symbol similar to its their kin in the Mainland Southeast Asia. The tricolours, locally named and shaded as *Kuning Keemasan* ([Golden yellow](/wiki/Gold_(color)#Golden_yellow)), *Hijau Lumut* ([Forest green](/wiki/Forest_green)) and *Merah Darah Burung* ([Torch red](/wiki/Shades_of_red#Spanish_red)) is in extensive use for ceremonial and cultural purposes and can be seen donning throughout the cities and towns of the region, its also considered as a favourite colour for the traditional Malay weddings in the two provinces. ## Gallery - [Sang Saka Malaya](/wiki/Sang_Saka_Malaya) - [Flag of Batak](/wiki/Flag_of_Batak) - [Malayness](/wiki/Malayness) - [Marawa Minangkabau](/wiki/Marawa_Minangkabau) - [Pan-African colours](/wiki/Pan-African_colours) ## Bibliography - Blackburn, Kevin; Hack, Karl (2012), *War, Memory and the Making of Modern Malaysia and Singapore*, National University of Singapore, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 978-997-169-599-6 - Che Husna Azhari (1997), \"Teknologi Warna Alam Melayu (Dye technology of the Malay world)\", *Akademika*, **51**, [Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia](/wiki/Universiti_Kebangsaan_Malaysia) - Kedah State Government (2015), *Profil Negeri - Bendera Negeri ('State profile - State flag')*, archived from the original on 2016-01-15, retrieved 2015-05-12 - Lemiere, Sophie (2015), *Gangsta to the roots: Gangsta beyond stereotypes*, New Mandala, archived from the original on 2015-04-19, retrieved 2015-04-11 - Pertubuhan Silat Seni Gayong (2013), *Lambang Gayong (Logo of Gayong)*, archived from the original on 2022-12-11, retrieved 2015-04-11 - Rahmah Ghazali (2014), \"Pekida: We are not rogues\", *The Star Online* - Rejimen Askar Melayu Diraja (2015), *Bendera RAMD (Flag of RAMD)*, archived from the original on 2015-04-14, retrieved 2015-04-11 - Umno Online (2014), *Bendera UMNO : 'Sang Saka Bangsa' (Flag of Umno: 'Sang Saka Bangsa')*, archived from the original on 2015-04-21, retrieved 2015-04-11\n",
