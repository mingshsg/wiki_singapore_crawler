  "content": "Term for Southeast Asian traditional village A ***kampong*** (this term is in [Za'aba Spelling](/wiki/Za%27aba_Spelling), ***kampung*** in both modern [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) and [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_language)) is a type of [village](/wiki/Village) in [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines), and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) and a 'dock' in [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia). The term applies to traditional villages, especially of indigenous peoples. This term has also been used to refer to urban [slum](/wiki/Slum) areas or enclosed developments and neighborhoods within towns and cities in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia, [Sri Lanka](/wiki/Sri_Lanka), and [Christmas Island](/wiki/Christmas_Island). The design and architecture of traditional *kampong* villages have been targeted for reform by urbanists and modernists. These villages have also been adapted by contemporary architects for various projects. ## Etymology The word *kampung* or *kampong* is derived from [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) and is commonly translated into English as \"village\". In Singapore, the traditional spelling *kampong* continues to be used, while the spelling *kampung* is standard in Malaysia and Indonesia. In Brunei, both spellings are interchangeable. The English word \"[compound](/wiki/Compound_(enclosure)),\" when referring to a development in a town, is thought to be derived from *kampong*. ## Brunei In Brunei, the term *kampong* (also *kampung*) primarily refers to the third- and lowest-level [subdivisions](/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Brunei) below [districts](/wiki/Districts_of_Brunei) ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language): *daerah*) and [*mukim*](/wiki/Mukims_of_Brunei) (subdistricts). Some *kampong* divisions are villages in a social sense as defined by anthropologists, while others may only serve for census and other administrative purposes. Others have been incorporated into the city limits of the capital, [Bandar Seri Begawan](/wiki/Bandar_Seri_Begawan), or into nearby towns. A *kampong* is generally led by a *ketua kampung* or [village head](/wiki/Village_head). Infrastructure-wise, it typically has a [primary school](/wiki/Primary_school) and a *balai raya* or *dewan kemasyarakatan*, the equivalent of a [community centre](/wiki/Community_centre). Because many *kampongs* have predominantly Muslim residents, each may also have a mosque for the [Jumu'ah](/wiki/Jumu%27ah) or Friday prayers and a school providing the Islamic religious primary education compulsory for Muslim pupils in the country. In Brunei, *kampong* and *kampung* are considered to be correct spellings, and both alternatives are common in written media and official place names. For example, [Keriam](/wiki/Keriam), a village in [Tutong District](/wiki/Tutong_District), is known as *Kamp**u**ng Keriam* by the Survey Department but *Kamp**o**ng Keriam* by the [Postal Services Department](/wiki/Brunei_Postal_Services_Department), both being government departments. ## Cambodia In Cambodia, *kampong* (កំពង់) is used to describe a place on a river or lake-shore where people can dock their private small boats. It also refers to a dock facility for commercial or passenger ferries and boats, such as Neak Loeung's ferry-dock (កំពង់ចម្លងអ្នកលឿង) and Akreiy Ksatr's ferry-dock (កំពង់ចម្លងអរិយក្សត្រ). The term *kampong* has been widely used in Cambodia, likely for thousands of years due to its proximity with the [Austronesian](/wiki/Austronesian_peoples) [Chams](/wiki/Chams), to name places such as provinces, districts, communes and villages. Some examples include: the provinces of *Kampong Som* (ក្រុងកំពង់សោម; currently Sihanoukville), *Kampong Cham* (ខេត្តកំពង់ចាម), *Kampong Thom* (ខេត្តកំពង់ធំ), *Kampong Chhnang* (ខេត្តកំពង់ឆ្នាំង), and *Kampong Speu* (ខេត្តកំពង់ស្ពឺ); the districts of *Kampong Trach* (ស្រុកកំពង់ត្រាច), *Kampong Trolach* (ស្រុកកំពង់ត្រឡាច), and *Kampong Siem* (ស្រុកកំពង់សៀម); the communes of *Kampong Khleang* (ឃុំកំពង់ឃ្លាំង) and *Kampong Kdei* (ឃុំកំពង់ក្តី); and the villages of *Kampong Prasat* (ភូមិកំពង់ប្រាសាទ), *Kampong Krabei* (ភូមិកំពង់ក្របី), and *Kampong Our* (ភូមិកំពង់អ៊ួរ). (Page 37, Chun Nat, *Dictionnaire Cambodgien,* Institut Bouddhique*,* Phnom Penh, 1967). Based on the examples above, the meaning of *kampong* in the [Khmer language](/wiki/Khmer_language) can also arguably be defined as \"an area or place located near a river or lake that people named as their own after they arrived, or formed their community at afterward.\" ## Indonesia In [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), **kampung** generally refers to a [hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet_(place)), which is considered the opposite of the [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_language) *kota* (\"city\" in English). However, most Indonesian cities and towns initially consisted of a collection of **kampung** settlements. There are four typologies of *kampung*. They are: inner city *kampung*, which has very high density and is inhabited by 100,000 people per square kilometer; mid-city *kampung*, which is inhabited by 20,000–40,000 people per square kilometer; rural *kampung*, which has very low density; and squatter *kampung*, where people are scattered in metropolitan areas. **Kampung** also usually refers to a settlement or compound of a certain [ethnic](/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Indonesia) community, which later became incorporated into a place name. Some examples include: the *Kampung Melayu* district in [East Jakarta](/wiki/East_Jakarta); *Kampung Bugis* ([Buginese](/wiki/Buginese_people) village); *Kampung Cina* (also known as *Pecinan*), which refers to a [Tionghoa](/wiki/Tionghoa) village or could be equivalent to [Chinatown](/wiki/Chinatown) as well; *Kampung Ambon* ([Ambonese](/wiki/Ambonese_people) village); *Kampung Jawa* ([Javanese](/wiki/Javanese_people) village); and *Kampung Arab* ([Arab](/wiki/Arab-Indonesians) village). On the island of [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra) and its surrounding islands, the [indigenous peoples](/wiki/Pribumi) have distinctive architecture and building features, including [longhouses](/wiki/Longhouse) and rice storage buildings in their *kampung*s. [Malays](/wiki/Malay_Indonesian), [Karo](/wiki/Karo_people_(Indonesia)), [Batak](/wiki/Batak_people), [Toba](/wiki/Toba_Batak_people), [Minangkabau](/wiki/Minangkabau_people), and others build communal housing and tiered structures. The term **kampung** in Indonesia could refer to a business-based village as well—for example, *Kampung Coklat* (lit. \"the Chocolate village\") in [Blitar](/wiki/Blitar), [East Java](/wiki/East_Java), which mainly produces and sells chocolate products (bars, candies, powders, coffee, cocoa butter, etc.) from the local [cacao](/wiki/Cocoa_bean) farmers; *Kampung Seni* (lit. \"the Arts/Performances village\") in various places across Indonesia where local artisans make and sell their crafts; and *Kampung Batik* (lit. \"the *Batik* village\") which mainly produce and sell *[batik](/wiki/Batik)*, offering [batik-making](/wiki/Batik) courses and training. In 2009, several *Kampung Batik*, in collaboration with the other official entities such as the Batik Museum in [Pekalongan](/wiki/Pekalongan), [Central Java](/wiki/Central_Java), were recognized by [UNESCO](/wiki/UNESCO) regarding the \"Education and training in Indonesian Batik intangible cultural heritage for elementary, junior, senior, vocational school and polytechnic students\" as part of the [Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity](/wiki/Masterpieces_of_the_Oral_and_Intangible_Heritage_of_Humanity) in Register of Good Safeguarding Practices List. The *kampung*s in Indonesia have attracted global tourists as well, such as *[Kampung Panglipuran](/wiki/Penglipuran)* in [Bali](/wiki/Bali), which was awarded as one of the world's cleanest villages in 2016. ## Malaysia In Malaysia, a *kampung* is defined as a locality with 10,000 or fewer people. Since historical times, every Malay village has operated under the leadership of a *[penghulu](/wiki/Penghulu)* (village chief), who has the power to hear civil matters in his village (see [Courts of Malaysia](/wiki/Courts_of_Malaysia) for more details). A Malay village typically contains a [mosque](/wiki/Mosque) or *[surau](/wiki/Surau)*, [paddy fields](/wiki/Paddy_field) or orchards, and wooden Malay houses on stilts. It is common to see a cemetery near the mosque. [Dirt roads](/wiki/Dirt_roads) are more common than paved roads for village people to travel between *kampongs*. The British introduced the *[Kampung Baru](/wiki/Kampung_Baru,_Kuala_Lumpur)* (\"New Village\") programme as a means of encouraging Malays to adapt to urban life. This is distinct from the [new villages](/wiki/New_village) established for the Chinese population under the [Briggs Plan](/wiki/Briggs_Plan) in 1950, which functioned as [internment camps](/wiki/Internment_camps) intended to separate suspected [Malayan National Liberation Army](/wiki/Malayan_National_Liberation_Army) (MNLA) guerillas of the [Malayan Communist Party](/wiki/Malayan_Communist_Party) (MCP) from their rural civilian supporters during the [Malayan Emergency](/wiki/Malayan_Emergency). Malaysia's long-serving prime minister [Mahathir Mohamad](/wiki/Mahathir_Mohamad) lauded urban lifestyles in his 1970 book *[The Malay Dilemma](/wiki/The_Malay_Dilemma)* and associated *kampong* village life with \"backward traditionalism\". He also had the *kampung setinggan* (squatter settlements) cleared and new buildings constructed to house their residents in proper housing. ## Philippines In the Philippines, especially in the southern part which is dominated by [Moro Muslims](/wiki/Moro_people), the word *kampung* was also adopted, but in a [Hispanized](/wiki/Hispanized) form, becoming *campo*. This name itself was originally the influence of the Malayanized Muslim powers that had triumphed in the south of the Philippines, such as the [Sultanate of Sulu](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Sulu), [Sultanate of Maguindanao](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Maguindanao), [Sultanate of Buayan](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Buayan), and [Sultanates of Lanao](/wiki/Confederate_States_of_Lanao). Especially the Sultanate of Sulu, because it is close to the spread of [Malay culture](/wiki/Malay_culture), its influence is very noticeable, in terms of vocabulary, in this case the word *kampung*. An example of a place called *kampung* is a [barangay](/wiki/Barangay) in [Zamboanga City](/wiki/Zamboanga_City), namely [Campo Islam](/wiki/Campo_Islam) or Kampung Islam (lit. 'Islamic Village'). ## Singapore Traditional *kampongs* were once widespread across Singapore, but few survive today, mainly on outlying islands such as [Pulau Ubin](/wiki/Pulau_Ubin). During the 20th century, many *kampongs* were located on the [mainland](/wiki/Singapore_Island). These *kampongs* were often overcrowded and considered unhealthy and unpleasant places to live, with numerous *kampongs* lacking proper sanitation. The [Singapore Improvement Trust](/wiki/Singapore_Improvement_Trust) (SIT), established in 1927 by the British to manage infrastructure and later public housing, struggled to keep up with demand and was slow to address Singapore's housing needs. Conditions only began to improve after the [1959 general election](/wiki/1959_Singaporean_general_election), when the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) under [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) came to power and the government formed the [Housing and Development Board](/wiki/Housing_and_Development_Board) (HDB) to tackle the housing situation. Following the [Bukit Ho Swee fire](/wiki/Bukit_Ho_Swee_fire) in 1961 and the rapid modernisation after the [independence of Singapore](/wiki/Independence_of_Singapore_Agreement_1965) in 1965, almost all *kampongs* across Singapore were removed and [new towns](/wiki/New_towns_of_Singapore) were established. In the subsequent decades, Singaporeans were resettled into [public housing](/wiki/Public_housing_in_Singapore), and today around 80 percent of the population lives in high-rise apartments. Before its conversion into a military area, [Pulau Tekong](/wiki/Pulau_Tekong) had several *kampongs*, and others were also found on the [Southern](/wiki/Southern_Islands) and [Western Islands](/wiki/Western_Islands,_Singapore). Although most have disappeared, traces remain in the form of [former mosques](/wiki/Former_mosques_of_Singapore) once serving *kampong* communities, and historic districts such as [Kampong Glam](/wiki/Kampong_Glam) retain the name. The best known surviving example is [Kampong Lorong Buangkok](/wiki/Kampong_Lorong_Buangkok), one of the last *kampongs* on the mainland. - [Barangay](/wiki/Barangay) - [Mukim](/wiki/Mukim) - [Rural area](/wiki/Rural_area) - [Village](/wiki/Village) - [Favela](/wiki/Favela)\n",
