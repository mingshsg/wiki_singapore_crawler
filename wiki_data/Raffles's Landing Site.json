The site is located at [Boat Quay](/wiki/Boat_Quay) within the Civic District, in the [Downtown Core](/wiki/Downtown_Core) of the [Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore)'s [central business district](/wiki/Central_business_district). ## History On 28 January 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles landed at this site for his first visit, which lasted ten days. During this period, with the help of Major [William Farquhar](/wiki/William_Farquhar), he concluded the first treaty with the local rulers [Temenggong Abdul Rahman](/wiki/Temenggong_Abdul_Rahman) and Sultan [Hussein Shah](/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor). The site is denoted by a [statue](/wiki/Statue) of [Sir Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Sir_Stamford_Raffles) and is located on the north [bank](/wiki/Bank_(geography)) of the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River). The present polymarble statue was unveiled in 1972 which was made from [plaster](/wiki/Plaster) [casts](/wiki/Molding_(process)) from the original 1887 figure that currently stands opposite Victoria Concert Halls. In 2019, as part of events commemorating the bicentennial of the [Founding of modern Singapore](/wiki/Founding_of_modern_Singapore), numerous alterations have been made to and around the statue of Raffles such as using [camouflage](/wiki/Camouflage) to make the statue 'disappear' into the backdrop of the buildings in [Raffles Place](/wiki/Raffles_Place) on the south bank, and erecting statues of Raffles's contemporaries such as [Munshi Abdullah](/wiki/Munshi_Abdullah), [Tan Tock Seng](/wiki/Tan_Tock_Seng), and [Naraina Pillai](/wiki/Naraina_Pillai) along with that of the founder of the [Kingdom of Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura), [Sang Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama). ## Plaque inscription The Plaque at the landing site reads \"On this historic site, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles first landed in Singapore on 28th January 1819, and with genius and perception changed the destiny of Singapore from an obscure fishing village to a great seaport and modern metropolis.\" ## Dispute There is a dispute as to where was the exact location that Raffles first landed in Singapore. While the north bank of the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River) is generally believed to be the location, there is another source that claims otherwise. Based on the Cho Clan Archives, Raffles ordered his ship's carpenter, Chow Ah Chi, to lead the way in posting the [British East India Company](/wiki/British_East_India_Company) flag on [mainland Singapore](/wiki/Pulau_Ujong) and he supposedly landed at the mouth of the [Rochor River](/wiki/Rochor_River) in [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang). Raffles, following the route taken by Chow, also arrived at the [Kallang Basin](/wiki/Kallang_Basin) in what is today's [Kallang Riverside Park](/wiki/Kallang_Riverside_Park). - [History of Singapore](/wiki/History_of_Singapore) - [Timeline of Singaporean history](/wiki/Timeline_of_Singaporean_history) - [Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles) ## Notes - Norman Edwards, Peter Keys (1996), *Singapore – A Guide to Buildings, Streets, Places*, Times Books International, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 9971-65-231-5 - National Heritage Board (2006), *Discover Singapore – Heritage Trails*, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-05-6433-3\n",
