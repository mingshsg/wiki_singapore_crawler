The planning area is bounded by the following planning areas - [Orchard](/wiki/Orchard,_Singapore) and [Museum](/wiki/Museum_Planning_Area) to the south, [Tanglin](/wiki/Tanglin) to the west, [Novena](/wiki/Novena,_Singapore) to the north, [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang) to the northeast and [Rochor](/wiki/Rochor) to the east. Occupying an area north of the renowned [Orchard Road](/wiki/Orchard_Road) shopping belt, the territory of Newton Planning Area includes the grounds of [The Istana](/wiki/The_Istana), the official residence and office of the [President of Singapore](/wiki/President_of_Singapore). It is split into six subzones; Cairnhill, Goodwood Park, Istana Negara, Monk's Hill, Newton Circus and Orange Grove. Newton's namesake, Newton Road, however, is located within Novena Planning Area, and starts at Newton Circus in the south and ends at the junction with [Thomson Road](/wiki/Thomson_Road,_Singapore) in the north. ## Etymology and history Originally Syed Ali Road, Newton Road was renamed in 1914 after [Howard Newton](/wiki/Howard_Newton_(engineer)) (died 1897), the Assistant [Municipal](/wiki/Municipal) [Engineer](/wiki/Engineer) in late nineteenth century Singapore, in order to avoid confusion with Syed Alwi Road. In 1933, Newton Circus, a 40-foot (12 m) wide circular [carriageway](/wiki/Carriageway), was constructed for [gyratory](/wiki/Gyratory) [traffic](/wiki/Traffic) according to a [Singapore Improvement Trust](/wiki/Singapore_Improvement_Trust) layout at the [focus](/wiki/Focus_(geometry)) of a number of converging roads, including Bukit Timah Road, [Dunearn Road](/wiki/Dunearn_Road), Newton Road, Keng Lee Road, Kampong Java Road, Bukit Timah Road, Clemenceau Avenue and Scotts Road. As eight roads converge on the Circus, the [Tamils](/wiki/Tamil_people) used to call Newton *ethumuchandi*, or \"the eight [junction](/wiki/Junction_(traffic)) place\". Newton Circus has become the site of a major [hawker centre](/wiki/Hawker_centre), [Newton Food Centre](/wiki/Newton_Food_Centre). - [Newton MRT station](/wiki/Newton_MRT_station) - Victor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2003), *Toponymics - A Study of Singapore Street Names*, Eastern Universities Press, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-210-205-1 This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
