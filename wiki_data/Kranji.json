Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *Find sources:* \"Kranji\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(April 2025)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*Subzone of Sungei Kadut Planning Area in Singapore **Kranji** is a suburb in northwestern [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), bounded by [Sungei Kadut](/wiki/Sungei_Kadut) to the north, Turf Club to the east, as well as Lim Chu Kang and the Western Water Catchment to the west. It is located about 22 kilometres (14 mi) from the [city centre](/wiki/Downtown_Core) and its name came from the [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) word \"Buah Keranji\" due to pronunciation by local Malay, it became \"Kranji\". ## Etymology Kranji is named after a local [tree](/wiki/Tree), *pokok* *kranji* or *keranji* ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) for *[Dialium indum](/wiki/Dialium_indum)*, velvet tamarind tree). ## History Kranji served as a [military camp](/wiki/Military_camp) before the [Japanese invasion of Singapore](/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore) in 1942. During [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II), the [Battle of Kranji](/wiki/Battle_of_Kranji) was the second stage of the [Empire of Japan](/wiki/Empire_of_Japan)'s plan for the [invasion](/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore) of Singapore. It is now the site of the [Kranji War Cemetery](/wiki/Kranji_War_Cemetery) and [Kranji War Memorial](/wiki/Kranji_War_Memorial), commemorating the 30,000 [Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) personnel who died in Singapore, [Malaya](/wiki/British_Malaya), [Java](/wiki/Java_(island)) and [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra) during [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II). Kranji is currently a prime residential area comprising mostly stand-alone properties. There are no towering apartment blocks, unlike most suburbs of Singapore. Along Kranji Road, it is also an industrial area. On 4 March 2000, the [Singapore Turf Club](/wiki/Singapore_Turf_Club) (STC) opened [Kranji Racecourse](/wiki/Kranji_Racecourse), replacing the [Bukit Timah Race Course](/wiki/Bukit_Timah_Race_Course). The racecourse is located next to the [Kranji MRT station](/wiki/Kranji_MRT_station). On 5 June 2023, it was announced that the STC will cease operations in March 2027 due to demand of land for housing and other projects. STC held its last race at the Kranji racecourse on Oct 5, 2024, and the club was expected to return the site to the Government by March 2027. The government has since taken back the land, and it was earlier announced that the site will be redeveloped into a new housing estate, with around 14,000 new public and private homes. ## Notable places - [Kranji Reservoir](/wiki/Kranji_Reservoir) which was formed by the [damming](/wiki/Dam) of the Kranji River. - [Bollywood Farms](/wiki/Bollywood_Farms) is an farming collective and organic growing education center in Lim Chu Kang. ## Transportation In 1903, the [Singapore-Kranji Railway](/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Singapore#Singapore-Kranji_Railway,_1900s) was launched with four stations, running from Tank Road to Kranji. It is connected to [Kranji MRT station](/wiki/Kranji_MRT_station) and is one of the main boarding and alighting stops to and from Johor Bahru for Bus Service 160 and 170/X. - Romen Bose (2006), \"Kranji - The Commonwealth War Cemetery and the Politics of the Dead\", Marshall Cavendish Editions, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-261-275-0 - Kranji War Cemetery and Singapore Memorial This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
