  "content": "Steamed bread dish **Da bao** ([Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 大包) or **dai bao** is an extra-large version of the [Chinese steamed bun](/wiki/Mantou). When translated, the name literally means 'big bun'. It originated in Guangzhou and is commonly sold in Canton, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. Compared to the smaller [xiaolongbao](/wiki/Xiaolongbao), the da bao uses fully fermented dough, giving it a less dense texture. The common fillings found in da bao usually consist of either pork or chicken minced meat and a hard-boiled egg. Other common fillings include mushrooms or Chinese sausage. Sweet and vegetarian versions also exist. - [List of buns](/wiki/List_of_buns) - [List of steamed foods](/wiki/List_of_steamed_foods) This article related to [Chinese cuisine](/wiki/Chinese_cuisine) is a stub.
