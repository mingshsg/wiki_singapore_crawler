  "content": "Americans of Singaporean birth or descentEthnic group **Singaporean Americans** refers to [Americans](/wiki/Americans) with [Singaporean](/wiki/Singaporeans) heritage or ancestry. Since the Singaporean government does not permit [multiple- citizenships](/wiki/Multiple_citizenship), it is not lawful for a person to hold both the Singaporean and American citizenships. Therefore, \"Singaporean Americans\" generally does not indicate that the person holds both the Singaporean and American citizenships. Additionally, because Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-ethnic country, the term \"Singaporean\" describes citizenship, not an ethnic group. There is a small community of Singaporeans in the United States, consisting largely of expatriate professionals from [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) and their families as well as [international students](/wiki/International_student). The bulk of Singaporeans in the United States reside in metropolitan areas along a coastline, with the highest population located within the corridor connecting Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C. On the West Coast, most Singaporean Americans live within several hundred miles of Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. The next highest concentrations are in Texas, followed by an enclave by the Great Lakes, near Chicago and Ann Arbor. ## Top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas with large Singaporean Americans population RankMSARegionSingaporean-Americans (descent)1[New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island](/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area)[Mid-Atlantic](/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_states)5332[Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana](/wiki/Los_Angeles_metropolitan_area)[Pacific](/wiki/Pacific_States)5053[San Francisco Bay Area](/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area)[Pacific](/wiki/Pacific_States)3684[Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown](/wiki/Greater_Houston)[West South Central](/wiki/West_South_Central_States)2695San Jose–Sunnyvale–Santa Clara[Pacific](/wiki/Pacific_States)2556[Boston-Cambridge-Quincy](/wiki/Greater_Boston)[New England](/wiki/New_England)1856[Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington](/wiki/Dallas-Fort_Worth_Metroplex)[West South Central](/wiki/West_South_Central_States)1858[Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue](/wiki/Seattle_metropolitan_area)[Pacific](/wiki/Pacific_States)1739[Washington-Arlington-Alexandria](/wiki/Washington_metropolitan_area)[South Atlantic](/wiki/South_Atlantic_States)16510[Chicago-Joliet-Naperville](/wiki/Chicago_metropolitan_area)[East North Central](/wiki/East_North_Central_States)136 ## Notable people - [Ng Chin Han](/wiki/Chin_Han_(actor,_born_1969)) – Hollywood actor - [Pragathi Guruprasad](/wiki/Pragathi_Guruprasad) - Playback singer - [Neeraj Khemlani](/wiki/Neeraj_Khemlani) – Co-president of [CBS News](/wiki/CBS_News) and [CBS Television Stations](/wiki/CBS_Television_Stations) - [Shin Lim](/wiki/Shin_Lim) – Magician - [Boon Thau Loo](/wiki/Boon_Thau_Loo) – Academic administrator, [University of Pennsylvania](/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania) - [Corrinne May](/wiki/Corrinne_May) – Musician, singer, and songwriter - [Julia Nickson-Soul](/wiki/Julia_Nickson-Soul) – Actress - [Lewis Tan](/wiki/Lewis_Tan) - Actor and martial artist, actor-stuntman father Philip is of Singaporean Chinese-British descent - [Sharon Tay](/wiki/Sharon_Tay) – Journalist - [Michael Yani](/wiki/Michael_Yani) – Tennis player - [Gwendoline Yeo](/wiki/Gwendoline_Yeo) – Actress, musician, and writer - [Daniel Chong](/wiki/Daniel_Chong) – Animator, writer, director, producer, and the creator of [Cartoon Network](/wiki/Cartoon_Network)'s *[We Bare Bears](/wiki/We_Bare_Bears)* - [Minfong Ho](/wiki/Minfong_Ho) - Children's and young adult novelist - [Po-Shen Loh](/wiki/Po-Shen_Loh) - Mathematician - Singapore portal - United States portal - [Singapore–United States relations](/wiki/Singapore%E2%80%93United_States_relations) - [Asian Americans](/wiki/Asian_Americans) This [United States](/wiki/United_States)-related article is a stub.
