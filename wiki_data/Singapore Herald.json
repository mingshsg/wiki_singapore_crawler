The government had accused the paper of being involved in \"[black operations](/wiki/Black_operations)\", of being funded by questionable foreign sources, of working up agitation against national policies and institutions and of \"taking on the government\". ## History In 1974, the government strengthened press control through the [Newspaper and Printing Presses Act](/wiki/Newspaper_and_Printing_Presses_Act). Its editors included [M.G.G. Pillai](/wiki/M.G.G._Pillai) and Adele Koh, who were both Malaysians. Koh later moved to Australia, becoming the second wife of [Don Dunstan](/wiki/Don_Dunstan), the former [Premier of South Australia](/wiki/Premier_of_South_Australia). - [Censorship in Singapore](/wiki/Censorship_in_Singapore) - [List of newspapers in Singapore](/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_Singapore) ## Sources - [Seow, Francis T.](/wiki/Francis_Seow) 1998. *The Media Enthralled: Singapore Revisited*.
