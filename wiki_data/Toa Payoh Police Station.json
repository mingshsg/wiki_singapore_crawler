[Toa Payoh Police division](/wiki/Singapore_Police_Force#Defunct_Units/Facilities) was closed down in 1988, with its areas of control taken over by [Tanglin Police Division](/wiki/Tanglin_Police_Division) ('E' Division) & [Ang Mo Kio Police Division](/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio_Police_Division) ('F' Division), respectively. The station became the Headquarters for the Police [Volunteer Special Constabulary](/wiki/Volunteer_Special_Constabulary) from 1988 until 1994, when Force Communications Branch of the [Police Technology Department](/wiki/Police_Technology_Department) took over the use of the building. The building was vacated again in year 2000 for a major refurbishment before utilisation by the Security Command. - [Toa Payoh ritual murders](/wiki/Toa_Payoh_ritual_murders) - Adrian Lim Murders This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
