In 1975, SJP joined the United People Front (UPF), a political alliance with the [United National Front](/wiki/United_National_Front_(Singapore)), Singapore Chinese Party, [Singapore Malay National Organisation](/wiki/Singapore_Malay_National_Organisation) (PKMS) and members of the [Barisan Sosialis](/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis) (BS) and [United Front](/wiki/United_Front_(Singapore)) (UF). On 14 August 1976, SJP left the UPF. In November 1976, SJP joined the Joint Opposition Council, a political alliance with PKMS, BS and UF. SJP contested the [1980 general election](/wiki/1980_Singaporean_general_election) and fielded two candidates in [Ayer Rajah](/wiki/Ayer_Rajah_Constituency) and [West Coast Constituencies](/wiki/West_Coast_Constituency). From 1988 to 1992, the party was mostly active in [Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency](/wiki/Marine_Parade_Group_Representation_Constituency), where it contested in two general elections and one by-election. In the contested elections, it had lost to the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party). It did not participate in the 1997 general election. In the run-up to the [2001 general election](/wiki/2001_Singapore_general_election), responding to [Chiam See Tong](/wiki/Chiam_See_Tong)'s call for a united front against the ruling [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party), the party joined with the [National Solidarity Party](/wiki/National_Solidarity_Party_(Singapore)), the [Singapore People's Party](/wiki/Singapore_People%27s_Party) and the [Singapore Malay National Organisation](/wiki/Singapore_Malay_National_Organisation) to form the [Singapore Democratic Alliance](/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Alliance) (SDA). Although SJP failed to win any seats since it was formed, the SDA managed to win one seat at [Potong Pasir](/wiki/Potong_Pasir), with [Chiam See Tong](/wiki/Chiam_See_Tong) of the [Singapore People's Party](/wiki/Singapore_People%27s_Party) as Member of Parliament. In addition, [Steve Chia](/wiki/Steve_Chia) of the [National Solidarity Party](/wiki/National_Solidarity_Party_(Singapore)) was appointed as [Non-Constituency Member of Parliament](/wiki/Non-Constituency_Member_of_Parliament) (NCMP). In 1996, the chairman [Desmond Lim Bak Chuan](/wiki/Desmond_Lim) had left SJP to join the [Singapore People's Party](/wiki/Singapore_People%27s_Party) (SPP). From March 2006, Aminuddin bin Ami was appointed as the secretary-general of SJP. In March 2011, after SPP left the SDA, Lim left SPP and rejoined SJP. He was subsequently appointed as the secretary-general of SJP. ## Leadership ### List of secretaries-general NoNameYearsRef1Muthusamy Ramasamy1975 - Unknown2Aminuddin bin Ami2006 - Unknown3[Desmond Lim](/wiki/Desmond_Lim)2011 - Present ## Electoral performance ### Parliament ElectionLeaderVotes%SeatsPositionResultContestedTotal+/–SeatsWonLost(/wiki/1976_Singaporean_general_election)Muthusamy Ramasamy5,1990.65%2020 / 69 7thNo seats(/wiki/1980_Singaporean_general_election)5,2710.83%2020 / 75 8thNo seats(/wiki/1984_Singaporean_general_election)10,9061.24%2020 / 79 7thNo seats(/wiki/1988_Singaporean_general_election)14,6601.09%3030 / 81 6thNo seats(/wiki/1991_Singaporean_general_election)15,2221.94%4040 / 81 5thNo seats #### Seats contested ElectionConstituencies contestedContested vote %+/–(/wiki/1976_Singaporean_general_election)[SMC](/wiki/Constituencies_of_Singapore): [Boon Lay](/wiki/Boon_Lay_Single_Member_Constituency), [Bukit Batok](/wiki/Bukit_Batok_Single_Member_Constituency)17.8%—N/a(/wiki/1980_Singaporean_general_election)SMC: [Ayer Rajah](/wiki/Ayer_Rajah_Single_Member_Constituency), [West Coast](/wiki/West_Coast_Single_Member_Constituency)16.0% 1.8%(/wiki/1984_Singaporean_general_election)SMC: Ayer Rajah, West Coast24.4% 8.4%(/wiki/1988_Singaporean_general_election)[3-member GRC](/wiki/Group_Representation_Constituency): [Marine Parade](/wiki/Marine_Parade_Group_Representation_Constituency)26.2% 1.8%(/wiki/1991_Singaporean_general_election)4-member GRC: Marine Parade22.8% 3.4% ### By-election ElectionLeaderConstituency contestedVotes%SeatsResultContestedTotal+/–WonLost(/wiki/1992_Singaporean_by-election)Muthusamy Ramasamy[Marine Parade GRC](/wiki/Marine_Parade_GRC)17641.14%040 / 4Lost - A small introduction on Justice Party\n",
