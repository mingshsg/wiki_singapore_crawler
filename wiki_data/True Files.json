  "content": "2002 Singaporean TV series or program ***True Files*** ([Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese): 真实档案) is an [English language](/wiki/English_language) [television](/wiki/Television) docu-[drama](/wiki/Drama) telecast on [MediaCorp Channel 5](/wiki/Channel_5_(Singaporean_TV_channel)), with each episode (except the last episode of Season 3, *The Unsolved*) re-enacting major court proceedings, mostly of [murder](/wiki/Murder), in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). When the inaugural season was telecast in 2002, its first episode was re-slotted to be telecast later, when numerous public feedback was received by the station complaining that it was too graphic after watching trailers for the pilot episode. The show was also pushed back to a 10 p.m. time slot from the fourth episode onwards as a result. Nonetheless, the hype helped the show to enjoy favourable viewership ratings. Over five years, a total of five seasons had been telecasted, with the final season airing in 2007. The show was hosted and narrated by veteran actor [Lim Kay Tong](/wiki/Lim_Kay_Tong) from Seasons 1 to 4. In Season 5, the host is [Tay Ping Hui](/wiki/Tay_Ping_Hui), and the narration is done by Brian Richmond. Currently, the show is viewable on [meWATCH](/wiki/MeWATCH) (previously named [Toggle](/wiki/Toggle_(website))). 60 out of 62 episodes (except for The Bukit Merah Maid Trial and Girl Thrown To Her Death episodes) is available on the said website from 5 February 2016 onwards. ## Episodes ### Season 1 (Thursdays, 10.00 p.m. (Tuesdays, 8:30 p.m. for 1st to 3rd episodes) - 1.

After Palakrishnan died in July 2003, the same year as Season 2's first telecast, [Subhas Anandan](/wiki/Subhas_Anandan) becomes the new legal consultant for this docu-drama from Season 3 onwards, which first aired in the following year (2004). - The closing credits for Seasons 1 and 2 flipped from page to page on a black screen, accompanied by random music. In Season 3, the closing credits scrolled from bottom-to-top in a red background similar to a scene in the opening sequence, featuring the allegory of justice found at the entrance of the [old Supreme Court building in Singapore](/wiki/Old_Supreme_Court_Building,_Singapore); as well as accompaniment by only the opening theme music. This background and music continued to be used for closing credits in Seasons 4 and 5, except that the credits flipped from page to page as per Seasons 1 and 2. - The front gate of [Changi Prison](/wiki/Changi_Prison), despite appearing in the opening sequence throughout the first season (and the opening sequence would remain unchanged throughout the entire telecast), only appeared as a background in one of the last episodes for that season, *The Burnt Body Case*, when the date of execution for that accused was revealed near to the end of the episode. This background would continue to be used at the end of most episodes in Seasons 2 and 3, either revealing the date of execution or the verdict for the accused, or any important information or records (such as in *The Story Of Koh Swee Beng*, it mentioned about the number of prisoners on Death Row being pardoned by the President of Singapore over a period of time). It was last used in *Fatal Step*, the second last episode of Season 3 and the last episode in that season to feature a High Court case (due to the following and last episode, *The Unsolved*, being a special, did not feature any High Court case as the murderers were never found). - *True Files* Season 1 - *True Files* Season 2 - *True Files* Season 3 - *True Files* Season 4 - *True Files* Season 5\n",
