  "content": "Radio station in Singapore **Sonar Radio** was an online radio station based in Singapore which played music ranging from [Electronica](/wiki/Electronica) and [Indie](/wiki/Indie_music) to [K-pop](/wiki/K-pop) from local and international artists. Sonar Radio was launched on 5 May 2011 by RADIOactive in conjunction with Samsung. Unlike many [contemporary hit radio](/wiki/Contemporary_hit_radio) stations, DJs at Sonar Radio are able to recommend songs and control the music playlist. The Sonar Radio player also incorporates several listener-friendly [social networking services](/wiki/Social_networking_service) such as voting for songs by 'liking' or 'disliking', sharing of song titles via [Facebook](/wiki/Facebook), [Twitter](/wiki/Twitter) or [e-mail](/wiki/E-mail) and display of song lyrics/music video of the song currently playing. Sonar Radio has been discontinued as of 2013. ## Staff ### Directorial Staff - Managing Director, RADIOactive: Andrew Crothers (formerly of [MediaCorp](/wiki/MediaCorp) [987FM](/wiki/987FM)) ### DJs - [Vanessa Fernandez](/wiki/Vanessa_Fernandez) (Ms Vandetta) (formerly of [MediaCorp](/wiki/MediaCorp) [987FM](/wiki/987FM)) - Chris Ho - [List of radio stations in Singapore](/wiki/List_of_radio_stations_in_Singapore) - Sonar Radio Official Website - Sonar Radio Facebook Page - Sonar Radio TuneIn Radio Page This article about a radio station in Asia is a stub.
