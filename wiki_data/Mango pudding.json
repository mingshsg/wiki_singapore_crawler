  "content": "Popular dessert in Hong Kong **Mango pudding** is a popular dessert in [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong). There is very little variation between the regional mango pudding's preparation. The dessert is also found in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand), [Macau](/wiki/Macau) and is often served as [dim sum](/wiki/Dim_sum) in [Chinese restaurants](/wiki/Chinese_restaurants). The fresh variant is prepared by the restaurant or eatery and consists of [agar](/wiki/Agar) or [gelatin](/wiki/Gelatin), [mangoes](/wiki/Mango), [evaporated milk](/wiki/Evaporated_milk), and [sugar](/wiki/Sugar). In addition, fresh fruit such as [mango](/wiki/Mango), [strawberries](/wiki/Strawberry), [berries](/wiki/Berry) and [kiwifruit](/wiki/Kiwifruit), are occasionally added as garnish. Served and eaten refrigerator cold, mango pudding has a rich and creamy texture. Some Chinese restaurants make the mango pudding in [fish](/wiki/Fish) shape because [goldfish](/wiki/Goldfish) or [koi](/wiki/Koi) expresses good luck in [Chinese culture](/wiki/Chinese_culture). ## In supermarkets Outside of dim sum and other restaurants, mango pudding can also be purchased at most Asian grocery stores or supermarkets. They can be purchased as a powder, which requires the addition of boiling milk or water to the powder, or in ready-to-eat portions.[*citation needed*] Factory-made mango pudding does not contain fresh mangoes and instead, consists of mango essence and either gelatin or agar.[*citation needed*] - Food portal - [Mango pomelo sago](/wiki/Mango_pomelo_sago) - [List of Chinese desserts](/wiki/List_of_Chinese_desserts) - [List of desserts](/wiki/List_of_desserts) - [List of fruit dishes](/wiki/List_of_fruit_dishes)\n",
