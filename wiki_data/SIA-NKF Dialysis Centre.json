  "content": "Medical facility in Singapore The **SIA-NKF Dialysis Centre** is a dialysis centre in [Toa Payoh, Singapore](/wiki/Toa_Payoh), and was the first dialysis centre outside of a hospital in Singapore. ## History The SIA-NKF Dialysis Centre, short for the [Singapore Airlines](/wiki/Singapore_Airlines)-[National Kidney Foundation](/wiki/National_Kidney_Foundation_Singapore) Dialysis Centre, was opened on 24 December 1987 by the second deputy prime minister [Ong Teng Cheong](/wiki/Ong_Teng_Cheong). The dialysis centre offered dialysis at cheaper costs as compared to treatments at private hospitals. The dialysis centre was sponsored by Singapore Airlines, who donated either $223,000, $233,000, or $250,000 to set up the centre. The centre cost $400,000 to construct. It was originally speculated that the centre was to be located in [Ang Mo Kio](/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio). However, the dialysis centre ended up being located in the [void deck](/wiki/Void_deck) of 220 Lorong 8 Toa Payoh instead. Besides being the first kidney dialysis centre outside of a hospital in Singapore, it was also possibly the first one in [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia). However, initially, the centre could only accommodate for 40 patients a month. The dialysis centre has been included in the Toa Payoh Heritage Trail by the [National Heritage Board](/wiki/National_Heritage_Board_(Singapore)). 1°20′22″N 103°51′13″E﻿ / ﻿1.3395°N 103.8535°E﻿ / 1.3395; 103.8535 This article about a Singapore building or structure is a stub.
