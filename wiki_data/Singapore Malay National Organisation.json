  "content": "Singaporean political party The **Singapore Malay National Organisation** ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language): *Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura*; [abbrev](/wiki/Abbreviation): **PKMS** / **SMNO** or **SUMNO**) is a political party in Singapore. ## History The origins of Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura (PKMS) were rooted in the [Singapore Malay Union](/wiki/Singapore_Malay_Union) (KMS), which was founded in 1926 by Mohamed Eunos bin Abdullah to represent Malay interests. Following the [Second World War](/wiki/Second_World_War), the KMS opposed the proposed [Malayan Union](/wiki/Malayan_Union) and merged into the [United Malay National Organisation](/wiki/United_Malay_National_Organisation) (UMNO), which would become dominant in federal politics.[*citation needed*] Despite its KMS's connections, the modern PKMS operated as an extension of the [Johor Bahru](/wiki/Johor_Bahru) branch of federal UMNO. It contested the [1955 Singapore general election](/wiki/1955_Singaporean_general_election) and secured one seat at [Ulu Bedok](/wiki/Bedok). By the [1959 Singapore general election](/wiki/1959_Singaporean_general_election), UMNO had gained three seats in the Malay-dominated electorates of [Geylang Serai](/wiki/Geylang_Serai), [Kampung Kembangan](/wiki/Kembangan,_Singapore), and the Southern Islands. On 20 February 1961, it became officially registered as the Singapore United Malay National Organisation (SUMNO). SUMNO subsequently joined the [Singapore Alliance Party](/wiki/Singapore_Alliance_Party) (SA), which was also an extension of the larger federal [Alliance Party](/wiki/Alliance_Party_(Malaya)), with local branches of the [Malayan Chinese Association](/wiki/Malayan_Chinese_Association) and the [Malayan Indian Congress](/wiki/Malayan_Indian_Congress), and former [Chief Minister](/wiki/Chief_Minister_of_Singapore) [Lim Yew Hock](/wiki/Lim_Yew_Hock)'s [Singapore People's Alliance](/wiki/Singapore_People%27s_Alliance). In line with the pro-Malay communal policies of its parent organisation, PKMS became a vocal opponent of [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew)'s [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party), which it accused of promoting [Chinese chauvinism](/wiki/Han_chauvinism) and discriminating against Malays. However, it also shared some of the PAP's policies, such as supporting merger with [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [anti-Communism](/wiki/Anti-Communism). The SA contested the [1963 general election](/wiki/1963_Singaporean_general_election), but performed poorly and lost the seven seats held under its constituent parties. The fallout from this electoral defeat contributed to [sharply deteriorating relations](/wiki/PAP-UMNO_relations) between the federal government in [Kuala Lumpur](/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur) and the Singapore state government which culminated in the [1964 race riots](/wiki/1964_race_riots_in_Singapore) that ultimately resulted in Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia in September 1965. On 19 March 1967, PKMS assumed its current name, after the Singapore government passed a new law banning local parties from operating as branches of foreign organisations. However, PKMS continued to maintain ties with its parent organisation, UMNO. During the [1968 general election](/wiki/1968_Singaporean_general_election), the PKMS did not file any nominations and supported [Barisan Sosialis](/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis)'s electoral boycott of the [Singapore Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore). PKMS did not win any seats in further elections. On 3 July 2001, the PKMS joined a political coalition known as the [Singapore Democratic Alliance](/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Alliance), which included the [Singapore Justice Party](/wiki/Singapore_Justice_Party), [Singapore People's Party](/wiki/Singapore_People%27s_Party), the [Singapore National Front](/wiki/Singapore_National_Front) and the [National Solidarity Party](/wiki/National_Solidarity_Party_(Singapore)). Throughout its history, the party has experienced substantial internal infighting. However, it all ended with a court order on 22 March 2012 which gave Abu Mohamed and the Supreme Council the rights to administer the office.[*citation needed*] ## Leadership - President: Abu bin Mohamed - Deputy President: Ismail bin Yacoob - Vice-President 1: Malik Bin Ismail - Vice-President 2: Kuswadi Bin Atnawi - Secretary-General: Muhammad Hairullah Bin Ahmad - Head of Youth Wing: Hasly Hashim - Head of Women Wing: Roziah Barik ## Election results ### Parliament ElectionLeaderVotes%SeatsPositionResultContestedTotal+/–SeatsWonLost(/wiki/1972_Singaporean_general_election)Ahmad Taff10,0541.3%2020 / 65 0 6thNo seats(/wiki/1976_Singaporean_general_election)Selamat Shamsuri9,230 1.2%2020 / 69 0 6thNo seats(/wiki/1980_Singaporean_general_election)Abdul Rahman Zin13,435 2.1%4040 / 75 0 6thNo seats(/wiki/1984_Singaporean_general_election)4,768 0.5%1010 / 79 0 8thNo seats(/wiki/1988_Singaporean_general_election)Ibrahim Ariff13,526 1.0%4040 / 81 0 7thNo seats(/wiki/1991_Singaporean_general_election)Sahid Sahooman12,862 1.6%4040 / 81 0 6thNo seats - Lau, Albert (1998). *A Moment of Anguish: Singapore in Malaysia and the Politics of Disengagement*.
