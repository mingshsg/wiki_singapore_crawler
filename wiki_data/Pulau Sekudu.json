  "content": "North-Eastern Island of Singapore **Pulau Sekudu** ([Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 青蛙岛), or **Frog Island**, is an [islet](/wiki/Islet) located just off [Chek Jawa](/wiki/Chek_Jawa) on [Pulau Ubin](/wiki/Pulau_Ubin), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It lies in the [Serangoon Harbour](/wiki/Serangoon_Harbour) opposite [Changi](/wiki/Changi). Despite its proximity, it is only reachable by boat, even at low tides. One can see the islet directly opposite the Chek Jawa Visitor Centre. ## Legend Legend has it that three animals from Singapore - a [pig](/wiki/Pig), an [elephant](/wiki/Elephant) and a [frog](/wiki/Frog) - had a challenge to see who could reach the shore of [Johor](/wiki/Johor) first. Whichever animal failed to reach the shore would be turned into [rock](/wiki/Rock_(geology)). All three creatures had difficulties swimming, and while the frog turned into Pulau Sekudu, both the pig and the elephant turned into a larger island, [Pulau Ubin](/wiki/Pulau_Ubin). ## Notes and references - Wild Singapore: Pulau Sekudu 1°24′17″N 103°59′19″E﻿ / ﻿1.40472°N 103.98861°E﻿ / 1.40472; 103.98861 This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
