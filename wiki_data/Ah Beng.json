  "content": "Term for anti-social youth in Singapore ***Ah Beng*** (Chinese: 阿明) is a [pejorative](/wiki/Pejorative) term applied to describe anti-social lower-class [youths](/wiki/Youth) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) and [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) who display common characteristics such as dyed hair, wearing loud fashion, and playing music in public. The female equivalent of an *Ah Beng* is an ***Ah Lian*** ([simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 阿莲; [traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 阿蓮; [Pe̍h-ōe-jī](/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB): *a-liân*). A stereotypical Ah Beng would be someone who is not highly educated, is loud and unsophisticated, and operates within secret societies and street gangs. Ah Lians, on the other hand, are regarded as [bimbos](/wiki/Bimbo), and are [stereotyped](/wiki/Stereotype) as [anti-intellectual](/wiki/Anti-intellectualism), [superficial](/wiki/Superficiality), [materialistic](/wiki/Economic_materialism), and shallow. The equivalent of an Ah Beng in other English-speaking countries is often said to be Australia's [bogans](/wiki/Bogan), the United States' [rednecks](/wiki/Redneck) and Britain's [chavs](/wiki/Chav). ## Etymology Ah Beng comes from the romanisation of the [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) pronunciation of 阿明 ([Pe̍h-ōe-jī](/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB): *a-bêng*). The character \"明\" ([pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *míng*; [Pe̍h-ōe-jī](/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB): *bêng*) is commonly used in the names of ethnic Chinese males in the region; the term \"Ah Beng\" alludes to their commonness. (The term is therefore semantically somewhat equivalent to the American expression \"Regular Joe\", though the social connotations differ.) Among Cantonese speakers, Ah Beng is also known as *lala zai* (啦啦仔). \"Lala\" has no actual meaning in itself, although it may have originated from the [Singlish](/wiki/Singlish) word \"la\"/\"lah\", while \"zai\" means \"boy.\" \"Lala zai\" refers to individuals who speak in Malaysian English or \"pure\" Singlish and who possess a strong preference for gaudy fashions or hairstyles. ## In popular culture Ah Bengs have been featured in several Singaporean films, including: - *[Army Daze](/wiki/Army_Daze)* (1996) - Adrian Lim Meng Kiat portrays [REC](/wiki/Military_recruit_training#Singapore) Teo Ah Beng who has a severe dislike of having to serve [National Service](/wiki/National_Service_in_Singapore) and is only doing it for the allowance. A recurring joke about Ah Beng is that everyone keeps telling him to speak [Mandarin](/wiki/Singaporean_Mandarin) when he keeps speaking [Hokkien](/wiki/Singaporean_Hokkien). - *[Money No Enough](/wiki/Money_No_Enough)* (1998) - A film about three [Singaporean](/wiki/Singaporeans) men whom are close and best friends who start a [car polishing](/wiki/Auto_detailing) [business](/wiki/Business) together to resolve their financial problems. - *S11* (2006) — A film about three [Singaporeans](/wiki/Singaporeans) whose lives coincide. The stereotypical Ah Beng was the [titular protagonist](/wiki/Title_character), [CEO](/wiki/Chief_executive_officer), [white-collar worker](/wiki/White-collar_worker) and [general contractor](/wiki/General_contractor) named Phua Chu Kang (portrayed by [Gurmit Singh](/wiki/Gurmit_Singh)) in the popular Singaporean local [sitcom](/wiki/Sitcom) known as *[Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd](/wiki/Phua_Chu_Kang_Pte_Ltd)*. In [the sitcom](/wiki/Phua_Chu_Kang_Pte_Ltd), Chu Kang's younger brother, Anthony Phua Chu Beng (portrayed by Edwin Chong in Season 1 and [Pierre Png](/wiki/Pierre_Png) from Seasons 2 to 8), is nicknamed Ah Beng, despite being an articulate and [educated](/wiki/Education) [architect](/wiki/Architect), which is the complete antithesis of an Ah Beng. - Singapore portal - Society portal - [NEET](/wiki/NEET) ### In other countries - [Alay](/wiki/Alay) (Indonesia) - [Ars (slang)](/wiki/Ars_(slang)) (Israel) - [Bogan](/wiki/Bogan) (Australia/NZ) - [Bōsōzoku](/wiki/B%C5%8Ds%C5%8Dzoku) (Japan) - [Cañí](/wiki/Ca%C3%B1%C3%AD) (Spain), a slur against [Romani people](/wiki/Romani_people) - [Chav](/wiki/Chav) (United Kingdom) - [Cholo](/wiki/Cholo) (Mexico) - [Dizelaši](/wiki/Dizela%C5%A1i) (Serbia) - [Dresiarz](/wiki/Dresiarz) (Poland) - [Eshay](/wiki/Eshay) (Australia) - [Flaite](/wiki/Flaite) (Chile) - [Gabber](/wiki/Gabber) / [tokkie](/wiki/Tokkie) (Netherlands) - [Gopnik](/wiki/Gopnik) (Soviet Union/Russia) - [Hoser](/wiki/Hoser) (Canada) - [Jejemon](/wiki/Jejemon) (Philippines) - [Kazan phenomenon](/wiki/Kazan_phenomenon) - [Malandro](/wiki/Malandro) (Brazil) - [Mat Rempit](/wiki/Mat_Rempit) (Malaysia) - [Ned (Scottish)](/wiki/Ned_(Scottish)) - Racaille [fr] (France) - [Raggare](/wiki/Raggare) (Sweden/Norway) - [Redneck](/wiki/Redneck) (United States) - [Skanger](/wiki/Skanger) (Ireland) - [Skeet](/wiki/Skeet_(Newfoundland)) (Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada) - [Tapori](/wiki/Tapori_(word)) / [Mawali](/wiki/Mawali) (India) - Trẻ trâu (Vietnam) - [Yankī](/wiki/Yank%C4%AB) (Japan) - [Yob (slang)](/wiki/Yob_(slang)) (United Kingdom and others) - [Zef](/wiki/Zef) (South Africa) ## Notes - Wong Kim Hoh, \"Who Says Ah Bengs Cannot Make It?\", *[The Straits Times](/wiki/Straits_Times)* (2 April 2006) - Samuel Lee, \"Hitting the Right Notes\", *[The Straits Times](/wiki/Straits_Times)* (21 April 2006) - Ah Beng and Ah Lian\n",
