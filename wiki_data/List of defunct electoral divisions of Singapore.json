  "content": "This is a **list of defunct electoral divisions** **of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore)**. ## History In 1988, following the establishment of [group representation constituency](/wiki/Group_representation_constituency) (GRC) and [single-member constituency](/wiki/Single-member_constituency) (SMC), all the constituencies are renamed as single-member constituency or group representation constituency respectively. In 2025, several GRCs were abolished to create double-barrelled named GRCs to \"better reflect the identities of the geographical areas in the GRCs\". ## Constituency - [Alexandra Constituency](/wiki/Alexandra_Constituency) -
