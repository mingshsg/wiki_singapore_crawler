  "content": "River in northeast Singapore **Sungei Punggol** ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) for **Punggol River**; [Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_character): 榜鵝河; [Pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): Bǎng'é Hé) is a [river](/wiki/River) located within the [North-East Region](/wiki/North-East_Region,_Singapore) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). ## Geography Other than [Punggol New Town](/wiki/Punggol_New_Town), the river flows through 7 other towns in the late 1990s and early 2000s, much of the river banks along Sungei Punggol have since been [reclaimed](/wiki/Land_reclamation) and the river canalised. Since 2011, it is now part of the Punggol Reservoir. In addition, Kampong Tongkang Pecah was along Sungei Punggol as well. ## Developments To better serve the recreational needs of the residents of Sengkang New Town, a network of green connectors have been built along the banks of Sungei Punggol. These connectors link the housing precincts to neighbourhood parks, the town park and [Sengkang Sports Centre](/wiki/Sengkang_Sports_Centre) in the [new town](/wiki/New_town). These park connectors are also linked to the [Coney Island](/wiki/Coney_Island,_Singapore) Park in Punggol New Town and [Punggol Park](/wiki/Punggol_Park) in Hougang. An artificial floating island has been constructed in the middle of the river in the Sengkang part of the river. The [Sengkang Riverside Park](/wiki/Sengkang_Riverside_Park), which opened in November 2008, is situated beside the Sungei Punggol. The [estuary](/wiki/Estuary) of Sungei Punggol has also been dammed to form a [reservoir](/wiki/Water_reservoir), in 2011 with Sungei Serangoon. - [Sungei Serangoon](/wiki/Sungei_Serangoon) 1°25′04″N 103°53′54″E﻿ / ﻿1.41778°N 103.89833°E﻿ / 1.41778; 103.89833 This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
