  "content": "Bridge in Clarke Quay, Singapore 1°17′21″N 103°50′42.1″E﻿ / ﻿1.28917°N 103.845028°E﻿ / 1.28917; 103.845028 **Read Bridge** is a [beam](/wiki/Beam_(structure))-structured [bridge](/wiki/Bridge) located at [Clarke Quay](/wiki/Clarke_Quay) within the [Singapore River Planning Area](/wiki/Singapore_River_Planning_Area) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). The bridge crosses the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River) linking Clarke Quay to Swissôtel Merchant Court. The bridge was built in 1881, completed in 1889 and opened on 18 April 1889. The bridge is opened to [pedestrians](/wiki/Pedestrian) and [bicycles](/wiki/Bicycle), and has been modified several times. ## History Prior to the Read Bridge, Merchant's Bridge stood in its place. There were plans to replace the bridge according to [Municipal Commissioners](/wiki/Municipal_Commission_of_Singapore) secretary D. G. Presgrave, though they were postponed until 1887. By that time, Merchant's Bridge was deemed to be \"old, dangerous, and unsightly\". It was decided that the new bridge would be named the Read Bridge after [William Henry Macleod Read](/wiki/William_Henry_Macleod_Read), a social activist. It would also be announced that a ceremony to initiate works on the bridge take place on 26 February. However, the ceremony took place on 1 March, with Read laying the first cylinder of the read bridge. On 3 November 2008, the bridge was selected for conservation as part of the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority)'s expanded conservation programme. - Victor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2004), *Toponymics - A Study of Singapore Street Names*, Eastern University Press, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-210-364-3 - National Library Board on Read Bridge This article about a Singapore building or structure is a stub.
