  "content": "Place in Singapore **Pulau Palawan**, also known as **Palawan Island**, is a slipper-shaped [islet](/wiki/Islet) located just off the southwestern coast of [Sentosa](/wiki/Sentosa), south of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It lies approximately opposite [Beach Station](/wiki/Beach_Monorail_Station) of the [Sentosa Express](/wiki/Sentosa_Express) monorail system, which is between Siloso Beach and Palawan Beach. *Palawan* is most likely a variant of the [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) word *pahlawan*, meaning \"hero\" or \"warrior\". Originally a [reef](/wiki/Reef) known as Serembu Palawan, and marked on at least one map as \"Palawan Reef\", it was renamed Pulau Palawan after land reclamation. The island now has an area similar to that of [Pulau Biola](/wiki/Pulau_Biola), about 0.4 hectares (0.99 acres). ## Confusion with \"Palawan Island\" off Palawan Beach Pulau Palawan is not to be confused with a U-shaped artificial sandy islet - named \"Palawan Island\" on some maps - off Sentosa's Palawan Beach. This islet is linked to Palawan Beach by a [simple suspension bridge](/wiki/Simple_suspension_bridge). It has two lookout towers, and there is a sign on the islet erected by the [Sentosa Development Corporation](/wiki/Sentosa_Development_Corporation) declaring that it is the \"southernmost point of Continental [Asia](/wiki/Asia)\". This may be disputed on the ground that the islet is not part of Continental Asia, as it is only linked to Sentosa by a bridge. (Sentosa itself is connected to the [main island](/wiki/Singapore_Island) of Singapore by a [causeway](/wiki/Causeway), and Singapore is in turn linked to [Peninsular Malaysia](/wiki/Peninsular_Malaysia) by a [causeway](/wiki/Johor%E2%80%93Singapore_Causeway). In addition, another beach on Sentosa called Tanjong Beach is further south than the islet.) Geographically, the actual southernmost point of mainland Eurasia continent is located in [Tanjung Piai](/wiki/Tanjung_Piai) in the neighboring State of [Johor](/wiki/Johor) of [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia). - [Geography of Singapore](/wiki/Geography_of_Singapore) ## Notes This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
