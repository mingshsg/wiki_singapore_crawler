They are nominated by the [prime minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) before being appointed by Parliament. The speaker is also second in the [presidential](/wiki/President_of_Singapore) line of succession. The current speaker is [Seah Kian Peng](/wiki/Seah_Kian_Peng), a [Member of Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore#Members_of_Parliament) (MP) for the governing [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) representing [Marine Parade–Braddell Heights Group Representation Constituency](/wiki/Marine_Parade%E2%80%93Braddell_Heights_Group_Representation_Constituency) (GRC), who took office on 2 August 2023. The speaker is assisted by two deputy speakers. In the event when the speaker is unavailable, the deputy speakers will preside over the parliamentary session. The current deputy speakers are [Christopher de Souza](/wiki/Christopher_de_Souza), MP for [Holland–Bukit Timah GRC](/wiki/Holland%E2%80%93Bukit_Timah_Group_Representation_Constituency), who took office on 31 August 2020, and [Xie Yao Quan](/wiki/Xie_Yao_Quan), MP for [Jurong Central Single Member Constituency](/wiki/Jurong_Central_Single_Member_Constituency) (SMC), who took office on 22 September 2025. Although Singapore is modelled after the [Westminster system](/wiki/Westminster_system), the speaker of Parliament can remain [partisan](/wiki/Partisan_(politics)), which is unlike their [counterpart in the United Kingdom](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(United_Kingdom)) who must remain strictly [non-partisan](/wiki/Independent_politician) and renounce all affiliation with their former political parties when taking office. ## Election Parliament must elect a speaker at the beginning of each new parliamentary term after a [general election](/wiki/Parliamentary_elections_in_Singapore). The [Constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Singapore) states that Parliament has the freedom to decide how to elect its speaker. By recent tradition, the [prime minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) nominates a person for the role. The person's name is then proposed and seconded by MPs, before they can be elected as speaker. The speaker may or may not be an elected MP, but must possess the qualifications to stand for election as an MP as listed in the Constitution. They cannot be an incumbent cabinet minister or parliamentary secretary. Once elected, a speaker continues in office until the dissolution of Parliament, unless they resign, are appointed as a cabinet minister, [minister of state](/wiki/Minister_of_state) or [parliamentary secretary](/wiki/Parliamentary_secretary), or are disqualified from being an MP. ## Role The role of the speaker in Singapore is similar to that in most [Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) legislatures. They preside over the sittings of Parliament, and enforces the rules prescribed in its Standing Orders for the orderly conduct of parliamentary business. In carrying out their duties, the speaker must remain impartial and fair to all MPs. The speaker regulates and enforces the rules of debate. They decide who has the right to speak, and put the question for Parliament to debate on and vote. The speaker does not take part in debates, but, being an elected MP, can abstain from or vote on a motion if they have a vote. As the speaker is considered the guardian of parliamentary privileges, MPs look to them for guidance on procedures, and for rulings on any [points of order](/wiki/Point_of_order). The speaker is second in the [line of succession](/wiki/Order_of_succession) for the office of [President of Singapore](/wiki/President_of_Singapore). In situations where the president's office is vacant, and the chairperson of the [Council of Presidential Advisers](/wiki/Council_of_Presidential_Advisers) is unable to take up the role, the speaker will assume the duties of the president until a new president is [elected](/wiki/Presidential_elections_in_Singapore). In terms of state protocol, they sit at the same level as the [chief justice of Singapore](/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_Singapore). The speaker acts as Parliament's representative in its relations with other legislatures and outside bodies. They also welcome visiting dignitaries, and represent Parliament at national events and during official visits abroad. Overall, they are in charge of the administration of Parliament and its Secretariat. The speakership is one of the few public sector roles in Singapore which allow their officeholders to automatically qualify as candidates in [presidential elections](/wiki/Presidential_elections_in_Singapore). ## List of speakers No.PortraitName Constituency (Birth–Death)Took officeLeft officeParty[Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore)**1**[Sir **George Oehlers**](/wiki/George_Oehlers) (1908–1968)22 April 19553 September 1963[Independent](/wiki/Independent_politician)[1st Legislative Assembly](/wiki/1st_Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore)[2nd Legislative Assembly](/wiki/2nd_Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore)**2****[E.
