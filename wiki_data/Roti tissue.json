  "content": "Indian-influenced sweet flatbread **Roti tissue**, **roti tisu**, or **tisu prata** is a sweet [flatbread](/wiki/Flatbread) often sold at [Mamak stalls](/wiki/Mamak_stall) in [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It is also known as \"roti helikopter\" (helicopter bread). Roti tisu is a thinner and crispier version of the traditional [roti canai](/wiki/Roti_canai) or roti prata. It is as thin as a piece of 40–50 cm round-shaped tissue. Roti tisu is available at most local Mamak stalls in Malaysia and Singapore and may be coated with sweet substances, such as sugar and [kaya (jam)](/wiki/Kaya_(jam)), or eaten with condiments such as ice cream. The popularity of roti tissue has spread to neighbouring [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), where it is found as street food in areas with significant Malays and Indian-Indonesian communities. - [Mamak stall](/wiki/Mamak_stall) - Food portal This [bread](/wiki/Bread)-related article is a stub.
