Concerns that rapid urban development will result in the removal of these trees especially due to the widening or realignment of these roads, the authorities identified 5 roads from a list of 55 suggested by the [National Parks Board](/wiki/National_Parks_Board). The remaining roads were placed on a watchlist to be closely monitored, and may be added to the scheme later.[*citation needed*] ## History As part of [Tengah Air Base](/wiki/Tengah_Air_Base)'s expansion, portions of [Lim Chu Kang Road](/wiki/Lim_Chu_Kang_Road), a heritage road, will be closed off. ## List of heritage roads - [Arcadia Road](/wiki/Arcadia_Road) - [Lim Chu Kang Road](/wiki/Lim_Chu_Kang_Road) - [Mandai Road](/wiki/Mandai_Road) - Mount Pleasant Road - [South Buona Vista Road](/wiki/South_Buona_Vista_Road) ## Roads on watchlist include - Goodwood Hill - Lornie Road - Loyang Avenue - Nassim Road - Punggol Road - Redhill Close - [Upper Thomson Road](/wiki/Upper_Thomson_Road) - Yishun Avenue 5 - Yuan Ching Road - Heritage roads\n",
