  "content": "Pastry with curry fillingThis article **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *Find sources:* \"Curry puff\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(January 2017)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* A **curry puff** ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language): *karipap, epok-epok*; [Jawi](/wiki/Jawi_script): کاريڤڤ / ايڤوق٢‎; [Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 咖哩角; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *gālí jiǎo*; [Thai](/wiki/Thai_language): กะหรี่ปั๊บ, [RTGS](/wiki/Royal_Thai_General_System_of_Transcription): **karipap**, pronounced [kā.rìː.páp]) is a [snack](/wiki/Snack) of [Southeast Asian](/wiki/Southeast_Asia) origin. It is a small [turnover](/wiki/Turnover_(food)) containing a filling of [curry](/wiki/Curry), often of [chicken](/wiki/Chicken_(food)) and [potatoes](/wiki/Potatoes), in a fried or baked pastry shell. The consistency of the curry is quite thick to prevent it from oozing out of the snack. *Pap* or *puff* reflects the Fujian Chinese dialect 泡 (*pop*), which means 'bubble, blister, puffed'. It contains influences from Indian, Malay and Chinese cuisines. Many variations of the snack exist throughout Southeast Asia and India, where it is a popular snack food. Although its origins are uncertain, the snack is believed to have developed in maritime Southeast Asia due in part to the various influences of the British Cornish [pasty](/wiki/Pasty), the Portuguese [empanada](/wiki/Empanada) and the South Asian [samosa](/wiki/Samosa) during the colonial era. The curry puff is one of several \"puff\"-type pastries with different fillings, though now it is by far the most common. Other common varieties include eggs, sardines, root vegetables and onions, or sweet fillings such as yam. ## Regional variations ### India In [Indian bakeries](/wiki/Indian_cuisine), vegetarian curry puffs with fillings like potatoes, carrots and onions are commonly available. They are generally sold as \"veg puffs\". ### Indonesia In Indonesia, a curry puff is known as a *[pastel](/wiki/Kue_pastel)*, although pastels do not necessarily contain any curry powder. ### Malaysia In Malaysia, curry puffs are commonly known as *karipap* and sold freshly fried at many Malay, Chinese and Indian bakeries, bazaars and street food stalls. The curry puffs from Indian bakeries differ from **epok-epok** in the use of layered pastry that creates a flaky crust. Other varieties of the **epok-epok** are filled with half a boiled egg instead of chicken. Another alternative is tinned [sardines](/wiki/Sardines_as_food). There are also vegetarian curry puffs that are not spicy and made from shredded radish, tofu, potatoes and grated carrots. They are often eaten with sweet chili sauce. ### Myanmar (Burma) The curry puff is a common snack sold in [Chinatowns](/wiki/Chinatown) and [tea shops](/wiki/Teahouse) throughout Myanmar, where is it known as *be tha mont* (ဘဲသားမုန့်; lit. 'duck meat pastry'). The traditional filling is [duck](/wiki/Duck_as_food) meat and potato spiced with [garam masala](/wiki/Garam_masala), onions, powdered chili peppers, garlic, and ginger. ### Singapore Curry puffs are commonly seen in *[pasar malams](/wiki/Pasar_malam)*, bakeries and food stalls in shopping centres. Additionally, the aforementioned *epok-epok* is a popular variation in some of Singapore's hawker centres, usually amongst Malay stalls. Alternatively, the more common type of curry puff has a thick or flaky English-style crust, with a mixture of Chinese and Indian styles in the filling. They may also be categorised into hand-made or mass-produced machine-made puffs in triangular shape or half wrapped circular shape. Both variations are popular in Singapore. Curry puff variations are usually denoted by coloured dye markings on the side of the puffs. Other puff snacks modelled on the curry puff concept have also been introduced, for example puffs with [yam](/wiki/Yam_(vegetable)), [durian](/wiki/Durian), [corn](/wiki/Maize), [red bean](/wiki/Azuki_bean), *[nata de coco](/wiki/Nata_de_coco)*, [grass jelly](/wiki/Grass_jelly), [bird's nest](/wiki/Egg_in_the_basket) and even [custard](/wiki/Custard) fillings. Besides the more uncommon fillings mentioned, there are also more conventional flavours which are popular with locals. These puffs are readily available in Singapore, which include sardine, black-pepper chicken and tuna fillings. In Singapore, [Old Chang Kee](/wiki/Old_Chang_Kee) has been selling curry puffs for over 60 years and now has outlets all over Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and the United Kingdom. ### Thailand In Thailand, a curry puff is known as a *karipap* (กะหรี่ปั๊บ). Assumed to have been adapted from the Portuguese *[pastel](/wiki/Pastel_(food))*, it arrived in Thailand during the [Ayutthaya period](/wiki/Ayutthaya_period) in the reign of King [Narai](/wiki/Narai) (1633–1688) from Portuguese-Japanese-Bengali cook [Maria Guyomar de Pinha](/wiki/Maria_Guyomar_de_Pinha), along with many [Thai desserts](/wiki/List_of_Thai_desserts_and_snacks) such as *[thong yip](/wiki/Thong_yip)*, *[thong yot](/wiki/Thong_yot)*, *[foi thong](/wiki/Fios_de_ovos)* and *[luk chup](/wiki/Luk_chup)*. Notable areas where **karipap** is popular are [Amphoe Muak Lek](/wiki/Amphoe_Muak_Lek), and Saraburi province in [central Thailand](/wiki/Central_Thailand), where [durian](/wiki/Durian) filling is used. ## Common ingredients - [Curry powder](/wiki/Curry_powder) - Potatoes - A small piece of [hard-boiled egg](/wiki/Hard-boiled_egg) - Meat, usually beef or chicken - Onions - [Puff pastry](/wiki/Puff_pastry) - [Cream cheese](/wiki/Cream_cheese), used mainly in [Americanized](/wiki/Americanized) variations of the food - Sardines - Food portal - Indonesia portal - Singapore portal - Malaysia portal - Thailand portal - [Bridie](/wiki/Bridie) - [Curry bread](/wiki/Curry_bread) - [Curry beef turnover](/wiki/Curry_beef_turnover) - [List of stuffed dishes](/wiki/List_of_stuffed_dishes) - [Pasty](/wiki/Pasty)\n",
