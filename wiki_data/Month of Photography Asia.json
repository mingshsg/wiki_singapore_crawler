The festival promoted photography both as an art form and as a creative industry. Each year, Month of Photography Asia was curated along a specific theme and presented works by international and Singaporean photographers in relation to this. The festival's main line-up of exhibitions was complemented by both public programmes, which included round tables, master classes, talks, portfolio reviews, screenings, tours and workshops. The festival was first established in 2002 as the Month of Photography in Singapore, on a joint initiative by the Alliance Française de Singapour and the [National Arts Council](/wiki/National_Arts_Council_(Singapore)). It was inaugurated in the presence of Jean-Luc Monterosso, director of the [European House of Photography](/wiki/Maison_Europ%C3%A9enne_de_la_Photographie), MEP). Phish Communications managed the 2003, 2004 and 2006 editions of the festival. In 2007, the festival took the name of Month of Photography Asia (MOPA or MOPAsia). ## Curatorial themes From 2004 onwards, a curatorial theme provided the backbone of each edition of the festival: - 2004: *Popular Pleasures through Photography* - 2006: *Le Regard Documentaire* - 2007: *Wanderings* - 2008: *Still/Moving: Photography & Cinema* - 2009: *Engaging Asia* - 2010: *Praxis* - 2011: *Memory* ## *Out of Focus* In 2006, the festival started a series of group shows titled *Out of Focus* dedicated to emerging Singaporean or Singapore-based photographers who had not yet had a solo show.

Alain Fleischer [Wikidata] was the first photographer in residence in 2008, followed by [Françoise Huguier](/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise_Huguier) in 2009. ## *InsideOut* In 2009, the festival added *InsideOut*, a project that aimed to allow the audience to see Singapore through the eyes of migrant workers to foster mutual understanding. First launched in 2006 together with the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival, the project was revived in the 2009 edition of MOPAsia as *InsideOut II* and continued in 2010 as *InsideOut III*. ## *ICON de Martell Cordon Bleu* photography award In 2010, the festival included the newly created *ICON de Martell Cordon Bleu* photography award. Established by [Martell](/wiki/Martell_(cognac)) Cordon Bleu together with the Month of Photography Asia, this juried prize was aimed at recognizing the most outstanding photographer in Singapore who had shown originality of vision, presented thought-provoking ideas, explored new concepts and demonstrated a commitment to his/her photography.
