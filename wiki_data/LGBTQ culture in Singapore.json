While homosexuality is legal in the country, the country is largely conservative. ## Arts and culture ### Media Portrayal of LGBTQ culture shown in media is subjected to [media censorship in Singapore](/wiki/Media_censorship_in_Singapore) with age-restricted ratings. The [Infocomm Media Development Authority](/wiki/Infocomm_Media_Development_Authority)'s policies on content on free-to-air television that it should not promote or justify the homosexual lifestyle. The 2020 [Mediacorp](/wiki/Mediacorp)'s Chinese TV series, *[My Guardian Angels](/wiki/My_Guardian_Angels)*, was criticised by the [LGBT community in Singapore](/wiki/LGBT_culture_in_Singapore) for perpetuating the stereotype that gay men are [paedophiles](/wiki/LGBT_stereotypes#Pedophilia_and_predation) and have sexually transmitted diseases. The sub-plot was also condemned by Action For Aids, a Singaporean non-governmental organisation \"dedicated to fighting [HIV/AIDS](/wiki/HIV/AIDS) infection\", who stated that \"The portrayal of gay men as paedophiles further perpetuates falsehoods that create further suffering among an already marginalised and stigmatised population.\" A second sub-plot involving parents, portrayed by [Kym Ng](/wiki/Kym_Ng) and [Brandon Wong](/wiki/Brandon_Wong_(actor)), worrying about the [sexual orientation](/wiki/Sexual_orientation) of their son, portrayed by [Benjamin Tan](/wiki/Benjamin_Tan), and behaving in a [homophobic](/wiki/Homophobia) manner, was also criticised. In response to the criticism, [Mediacorp](/wiki/Mediacorp) issued an apology, stating that it had \"no intention to disrespect or discriminate against the LGBTQ community in the drama\". A spokesperson for the company stated that the first sub-plot was meant to \"encourage young people to be aware of potential dangers and not be afraid to speak up and protect themselves\", and that the second sub-plot was meant to \" depict the real life struggles some parents face in communicating with their children on topics such as relationships and sexual orientation\". ## Internet Singapore has particularly established [LGBTQ](/wiki/LGBTQ) portals owing to its high Internet penetration rates and the restriction on LGBT content in print and broadcast media. - Blowing Wind Gay Forum is an online discussion forum for gay men in Singapore started in 1997 to discuss any issues which concern them. It eschews political, religious, and anti-racial topics. - [Dear Straight People](/wiki/Dear_Straight_People) is a media platform focused on content related to and concerning the LGBTQ+ community. Founded by Sean Foo in July 2015, Dear Straight People has become Singapore's leading LGBTQ+ publication. - Fridae.asia is an English-language LGBT news and social networking portal founded in 2000 by Stuart Koe. Fridae was popular during the early 2000s, but has become largely inactive during the 2010s. - Gay SG Confessions, also known as 'GSC' – Started in February 2013 in the footsteps of a host of popular \"[confessions](/wiki/Confessions_page)\" websites, GSC is a Facebook page that hosts a collection of user-contributed stories by gay, bisexual, lesbian, straight, transgender and curious members. The page was a sleeper published over 500 'confessions' or posts within less than 2 weeks of its creation and garnering over 10,000-page 'Likes' in slightly over 6 months. The site is run by an anonymous moderator, an account director in an advertising firm in his 30s who wants to be known only as \"GC\". Gay SG Confessions rebranded itself to GLBT Voices, and in 2017 announced its closure. After a 3-year hiatus, GLBT Voices announced its comeback, but its reach and influence has waned since its heyday in 2013. GLBT Voices is now largely inactive on social media. - [Trevvy](/wiki/Trevvy), formerly known as SgBoy – was set up in March 1999, originally known as \"Singapore Boy Homepage\" before being renamed SgBoy. It is one of the most popular LGBT portals in Singapore. It underwent a makeover, rebranding itself as Trevvy.com in August 2006, shifting its focus to the more mature 25 to 40-year age group of the local gay market and expanding its user base regionally. On 30 April 2021, Trevvy.com announced the closure of its website, due to its dwindling popularity. ## Organisations supporting LGBT rights - The Free Community Church - Pelangi Pride Centre (PPC), Singapore's first physical LGBT Centre, operating since 2003 - [OogaChaga](/wiki/Oogachaga), LGBT+ counselling service, operating since 1999 ## Notable residents ### Historical - [Paddy Chew](/wiki/Paddy_Chew) was the first Singaporean to publicly declare his HIV-positive status.
