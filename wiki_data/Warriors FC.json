Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *Find sources:* \"Warriors FC\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(October 2014)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*Football club **Warriors Football Club** was a Singaporean professional [football](/wiki/Association_football) club based in [Choa Chu Kang](/wiki/Choa_Chu_Kang), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), that played in the [Singapore Premier League](/wiki/Singapore_Premier_League), the top division of football in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). Before changing their name on 20 January 2013, they were previously known as the **Singapore Armed Forces Football Club** (**SAFFC**) since their establishment on 16 February 1996. Despite their name back then, not all players from the team came from the [Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces). Some were internationals and others were foreign. The club's original choice of mascot was a wolf, but club officials chose a rhinoceros, which represents discipline, spirit, courage and teamwork. Warriors are currently the most successful club in the history of the Singapore league since its inception, having won the league title a **record 9 times** in 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2014 and finishing second on four occasions in 1996, 1999, 2001 and 2005. ## History ### 1975–1995 The **Singapore Armed Forces Sports Association** (SAFSA) football team was formed in 1975 to provide talented footballers serving [National Service](/wiki/National_Service) with opportunities to play competitive football. That year, they won the President's Cup, a feat that they repeated in 1978, when they also captured the National Football League title to complete [double](/wiki/Double_(association_football)). Their Under-19 team won the national Under-19 title in 1979, 1980 and 1983, while the 1981 season of the National Football League saw the SAFSA emerge as unbeaten champions. The President's Cup was won by them again in 1984 and 1986, the latter time as part of a second double, as they also won the National Football League on goal difference. In 1990, the Pools Cup went to the SAFSA and their convincing displays led to their selection as one of eight clubs to compete in the newly formed [S.League](/wiki/S.League). ### 1996–2005 The club than revamp it named to **Singapore Armed Forces Football Club** (SAFFC) and also adopt a new mascot as in its club logo where they joined the inaugural [S.League](/wiki/S.League) in 1996. The reserve team which still keep its old name and old logo also resulted in the withdrawal of SAFSA from the National Football League. SAFSA would not participate in Singaporean football leagues again until 1999, when they rejoined the league. SAFFC than finished second in 1996 in its debut season where they signed 5 Croatian players [Ivica Raguž](/wiki/Ivica_Ragu%C5%BE), Jure Ereš, [Velimir Crljen](/wiki/Velimir_Crljen), Davor Mioč and [Goran Grubesic](/wiki/Goran_Grubesic). With Grubesic leaving the club at the end of the 1996 season, SAFFC continued with 4 of the remaining foreigners where the club went on to win back-to-back S.League title in (/wiki/1997_S.League) and (/wiki/1998_S.League). After retiring from football, club captain [Fandi Ahmad](/wiki/Fandi_Ahmad) took over from [Mladen Pralija](/wiki/Mladen_Pralija) as the club head coach in 1999 where he guided them to win the S.League title in (/wiki/2000_S.League) and (/wiki/2002_S.League). Three coaches were at the reins during this period, each lasting only one season. SAFFC finished second in 2005 but otherwise outside the top two. ### 2006–2012 Singaporean [Richard Bok](/wiki/Richard_Bok) took over as SAFFC's head coach in 2006 and led them to four consecutive league championships from 2006 to 2009. In 2008, SAFFC became the first Singaporean club to achieve a back-to-back domestic double, after winning both the [S.League](/wiki/S.League) and the [Singapore Cup](/wiki/Singapore_Cup) in 2007 and 2008. #### AFC Champions League debut In 2009, SAFFC qualified for the [AFC Champions League](/wiki/AFC_Champions_League) by defeating Thailand champions [PEA](/wiki/Buriram_United_F.C.) and [PSMS Medan](/wiki/PSMS_Medan) of Indonesia in the Eastern zone play-offs, becoming Singapore's first-ever representative at the highest club competition in Asia. SAFFC were drawn in a group with [J.League](/wiki/J.League) champions [Kashima Antlers](/wiki/Kashima_Antlers), [K League](/wiki/K_League) champions [Suwon Samsung Bluewings](/wiki/Suwon_Samsung_Bluewings) and [Chinese Super League](/wiki/Chinese_Super_League) runners-up [Shanghai Shenhua](/wiki/Shanghai_Shenhua). They lost all of their matches, except for a 1–1 draw against Shanghai Shenhua at home. In 2010, SAFFC qualified for their second consecutive AFC Champions League by registering a 3–0 home win against [Sriwijaya](/wiki/Sriwijaya_F.C.) of Indonesia and defeated [Muangthong United](/wiki/Muangthong_United_F.C.) of Thailand in the Eastern zone play-off final, again at home. Against [Henan Jianye](/wiki/Henan_Jianye) of China in the group stage, they drew in the two teams' first encounter and won the return leg 2–1 in Singapore, finishing third in a group that also contained familiar rivals Suwon Samsung Bluewings and former champions [Gamba Osaka](/wiki/Gamba_Osaka). ### 2013–2019 On 20 January 2013, SAFFC announced that they had changed their name to **Warriors Football Club** ahead of the [2013 S.League](/wiki/2013_S.League) season. Englishmen [Alex Weaver](/wiki/Alex_Weaver), in his first full season as coach of Warriors FC, clinched the [2014 S.League](/wiki/2014_S.League) title on the last day of the competition for the Warriors. With [DPMM](/wiki/DPMM_FC) of [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei) leading the table until the last day, the Warriors scored a 1–0 win over [Albirex Niigata Singapore](/wiki/Albirex_Niigata_Singapore_FC) and received a favour from [Tampines Rovers](/wiki/Tampines_Rovers_FC), who beat DPMM 2–1 to hand Warriors their first title in 5 years and their 9th title in the league's 19-year history. However, good times did not last for the Warriors. In November 2019, the team were brought to court and charged with 107 counts of not paying salaries for their staff. In total, they failed to pay more than S$350,000 in salaries to about 30 employees, including players, coaches and supporting staff. 2 days after the incident was reported, ST reported that there were 2 parties that were interested to take over Warriors FC. On 31 December 2019, the FAS had instructed the Warriors to sit out the 2020 Singapore Premier League season due to their financial and legal issues. They applied to return to the Singapore Premier League and Singapore Cup competitions for 2021 to no avail. ## Stadium The Warriors were initially based at the [Jurong Stadium](/wiki/Jurong_Stadium) until 2000, before permanetely moving to the 4,268 capacity [Choa Chu Kang Stadium](/wiki/Choa_Chu_Kang_Stadium) in 2001. **Permanently sealed success into history at Choa Chu Kang Stadium** The stadium has become familiar for its elegant and soaring curved white steel roof, with supporting pylons, that covers the main grandstand. The [football](/wiki/Football_(soccer)) pitch itself consists of a self-watering \"cell-system\" turf pitch installation, supplied from Switzerland and approved by [FIFA](/wiki/FIFA) for international competition. The club has won 6 League titles during their time here. Before the [2015 SEA Games](/wiki/2015_SEA_Games) commenced, they had to vacate Choa Chu Kang Stadium and instead played their home matches at the [Woodlands Stadium](/wiki/Woodlands_Stadium) for the [2015 season](/wiki/2015_S.League) instead. ## Seasons SeasonName ChangedLeaguePos.PWDLGSGAPtsSingapore CupLeague Cup[1996-1](/wiki/1996_S.League)Singapore Armed Forces[S.League](/wiki/S.League)4th14536272518[1996-2](/wiki/1996_S.League)1st14950321432(/wiki/1997_S.League)1st161213421137(/wiki/1998_S.League)1st201442461746Runners-up(/wiki/1999_S.League)2nd221471632449Winners(/wiki/2000_S.League)1st221642531552Runners-up(/wiki/2001_S.League)2nd3324271014674Third place(/wiki/2002_S.League)1st3326611043784Quarter-finals(/wiki/2003_S.League)3rd33202–56683769Group stage(/wiki/2004_S.League)4th2714310454845Quarter-finals(/wiki/2005_S.League)2nd271575544152Semi-finals(/wiki/2006_S.League)1st302082713668Quarter-finals(/wiki/2007_S.League)1st332544953879Winners[Withdrew](/wiki/2007_Singapore_League_Cup)(/wiki/2008_S.League)1st332454853477[Winners](/wiki/2008_Singapore_Cup)[Quarter-finals](/wiki/2008_Singapore_League_Cup)(/wiki/2009_S.League)1st302217733167[Round of 16](/wiki/2009_Singapore_Cup)[Runners-up](/wiki/2009_Singapore_League_Cup)(/wiki/2010_S.League)4th3316512564153[Round of 16](/wiki/2010_Singapore_Cup)[Quarter-finals](/wiki/2010_Singapore_League_Cup)(/wiki/2011_S.League)3rd332139743966[Quarter-finals](/wiki/2011_Singapore_Cup)[Quarter-finals](/wiki/2011_Singapore_League_Cup)(/wiki/2012_S.League)7th249510434132[Winners](/wiki/2012_Singapore_Cup)[Semi-finals](/wiki/2012_Singapore_League_Cup)(/wiki/2013_S.League)Warriors7th279810383835[Preliminary](/wiki/2013_Singapore_Cup)[Group stage](/wiki/2013_Singapore_League_Cup)(/wiki/2014_S.League)1st271656533553[Preliminary](/wiki/2014_Singapore_Cup)[Group stage](/wiki/2014_Singapore_League_Cup)(/wiki/2015_S.League)5th2711412405137[Quarter-finals](/wiki/2015_Singapore_Cup)[Group stage](/wiki/2015_Singapore_League_Cup)(/wiki/2016_S.League)7th247710393928[Preliminary](/wiki/2016_Singapore_Cup)[Group stage](/wiki/2016_Singapore_League_Cup)(/wiki/2017_S.League)5th24978333634[Preliminary](/wiki/2017_Singapore_Cup)[Runners-up](/wiki/2017_Singapore_League_Cup)(/wiki/2018_Singapore_Premier_League)[Singapore Premier League](/wiki/Singapore_Premier_League)5th247710323528[Quarter-finals](/wiki/2018_Singapore_Cup)(/wiki/2019_Singapore_Premier_League)7th246513405622[Runners-up](/wiki/2019_Singapore_Cup) - The [1996 season](/wiki/1996_S.League) of the S.League was split into two series.
