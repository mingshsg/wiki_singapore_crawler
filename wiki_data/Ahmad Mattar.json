  "content": "Former Singaporean politician **Ahmad bin Mohamed Mattar** (born 13 August 1940) is a former Singaporean politician and academic who served as the inaugural [Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs](/wiki/Minister-in-charge_of_Muslim_Affairs) from 1977 and 1993 and [Minister for the Environment](/wiki/Ministry_of_Sustainability_and_the_Environment) from 1985 to 1993. A former member of the governing [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP), he was the [Member of Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore#Members_of_Parliament) (MP) for [Leng Kee Constituency](/wiki/Leng_Kee_Single_Member_Constituency) between 1972 and 1976, [Brickworks Constituency](/wiki/Brickworks_Constituency) between 1976 and 1988 and the Brickworks division of [Brickworks Group Representation Constituency](/wiki/Brickworks_Group_Representation_Constituency) (GRC) between 1988 and 1996. ## Early life and education Born when Singapore was part of the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements), Ahmad studied at [Raffles Institution](/wiki/Raffles_Institution) (RI) before graduating from the University of Singapore (now the [National University of Singapore](/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore)) with a [Bachelor of Science](/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science) (BSc) in [physics](/wiki/Physics) in 1963. He later obtained his [Master of Science](/wiki/Master_of_Science) (MSc) at the [University of Sheffield](/wiki/University_of_Sheffield) on a [Colombo Plan](/wiki/Colombo_Plan) scholarship and earned his [Doctor of Science](/wiki/Doctor_of_Science) (DSc) at the University of Singapore. ## Career Prior to entering politics, Ahmad was a lecturer at [Singapore Polytechnic](/wiki/Singapore_Polytechnic) (SP) and conducted the first large-scale study on the effects of traffic noise on housing estates in Singapore; the study would later inform future legislations and studies on traffic noise. In 1982, he founded Mendaki, an organisation established to look into the educational and welfare needs of the Singaporean [Malay](/wiki/Malay_Singaporeans)–[Muslim](/wiki/Islam_in_Singapore) community, and served as its president until 1989. ### Political career During the early 1970s, Ahmad was recruited by the PAP. On the recommendation of [Abdul Rahim Ishak](/wiki/Abdul_Rahim_Ishak), incumbent MP for [Siglap Constituency](/wiki/Siglap_Single_Member_Constituency) and younger brother of [Yusof Ishak](/wiki/Yusof_Ishak), the inaugural [President of Singapore](/wiki/President_of_Singapore), he stood in [Leng Kee Constituency](/wiki/Leng_Kee_Single_Member_Constituency) during the [1972 general election](/wiki/1972_Singaporean_general_election) and won. From 1977 to 1993, he served as the inaugural [Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs](/wiki/Minister-in-charge_of_Muslim_Affairs), a role created to strengthen understanding and improve relations between the Singaporean [Malay](/wiki/Malay_Singaporeans)–[Muslim](/wiki/Islam_in_Singapore) community and the government. From 1985 to 1993, he served as the [Minister for the Environment](/wiki/Minister_for_the_Environment_and_Water_Resources_(Singapore)) in the [7th](/wiki/Seventh_Lee_Kuan_Yew_Cabinet) and [8th Cabinets](/wiki/Eighth_Lee_Kuan_Yew_Cabinet) under [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew). During his tenure, he was noted for tightening restrictions on the sale of aerosols containing [chlorofluorocarbons](/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon) (CFCs), continuing the clean-up of the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River) and introducing the [corrective work order](/wiki/Corrective_work_order) (CWO) to combat littering through the public shaming of \"litterbugs\". Despite plans to resign from the Cabinet after the [1991 general election](/wiki/1991_Singaporean_general_election), he was persuaded by newly elected prime minister [Goh Chok Tong](/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong), who succeeded Lee, to remain for a final term in his [first Cabinet](/wiki/First_Goh_Chok_Tong_Cabinet). In 1993, Ahmad resigned from the Cabinet; he remained a [backbencher](/wiki/Backbencher) until his full retirement from politics at the [1997 general election](/wiki/1997_Singaporean_general_election). He has largely kept a low profile since. ## Personal life Ahmad is the uncle of Siti Alia Mattar, a [Workers' Party](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Singapore)) (WP) candidate for [Punggol GRC](/wiki/Punggol_Group_Representation_Constituency) in the [2025 general election](/wiki/2025_Singaporean_general_election). The WP team lost to [Gan Kim Yong](/wiki/Gan_Kim_Yong) and his PAP team with 44.83% of the vote.
