He is of Cantonese descent and speaks Cantonese. ## Career Leong started his showbiz career as a television actor and starred in several [TCS](/wiki/Television_Corporation_of_Singapore) English and Chinese language dramas during the 1990s before diversifying into theatre and comedy. Having learned French while studying at the French-Singapore Institute, he is fluent in the language and worked with the [Alliance française](/wiki/Alliance_fran%C3%A7aise) for some time.

Besides acting, Leong was also a radio deejay with [Gold 90.5FM](/wiki/Gold_90.5FM). He came under media spotlight after he was reportedly censured for announcing the disruption to the [Circle Line](/wiki/Circle_Line_(Singapore)) train services on the morning of 14 December 2011 as [SMRT](/wiki/SMRT_Corporation) had not issued an official statement. As host of the weekday breakfast show, Leong had a practice of reading out user comments on Twitter account regarding public transport and traffic conditions. The station's response triggered massive criticism from many netizens and listeners already angered by SMRT's delay in announcing the disruption, which took place during the early morning \"rush hour\" and affected thousands. Leong later released an apology on his Twitter account and asked readers to \"move on\" from the incident. ## Filmography ### Film YearTitleRoleRef2017*[The Fortune Handbook](/wiki/The_Fortune_Handbook)*Fortune God intern2007*[Just Follow Law](/wiki/Just_Follow_Law)*Land Redevelopment Authority (LRA) Representative2005*One Last Dance*Treesan2002*[I Not Stupid](/wiki/I_Not_Stupid)*Ben2001*[One Leg Kicking](/wiki/One_Leg_Kicking)*Eugene ### Television YearTitleRoleNotesRef2017*[Eat Already? 3](/wiki/Eat_Already%3F_3)*Mo Dok2016-2017*[Eat Already? 2](/wiki/Eat_Already%3F_2)*Mo Mun2009*[Perfect Cut](/wiki/Perfect_Cut) II* 一切完美22006*[ABC DJ](/wiki/ABC_DJ)*[Executive producer](/wiki/Executive_producer)2005*[A New Life](/wiki/A_New_Life_(Singaporean_TV_series))* 有福Ah Gen1996*Can I Help You?*Jimmy Tok ### Theatre YearTitleRole2019Hossan-ah! 502017Army Daze 2Malcolm Png2012The Hossan Leong Show 2012 - Flying Solo2011The Hossan Leong Show 2011 (Episode 3)2010The Hossan Leong Show 2010 (Episode 2)2009The Hossan Leong Show2002*Forbidden City: Portrait of An Empress*Gatekeeper 11997*[Chang & Eng](/wiki/Chang_%26_Eng)*Royal Messenger/Doctor ### Shows hosted - *[We Are Singaporeans](/wiki/We_Are_Singaporeans) (2011 - present)* - *[The Rocky Horror Show](/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Show) (2012)* (Singapore tour) - *National Day Parade 2014* - Hossan Leong at [IMDb](/wiki/IMDb_(identifier)) - Agency's profile - Profile on xin.msn.com - Official Twitter Page This article about a Singaporean actor is a stub.
