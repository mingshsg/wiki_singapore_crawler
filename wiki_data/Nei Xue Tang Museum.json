  "content": "Museum in Singapore The **Nei Xue Tang Museum** (\"Hall of Inner Learning\") ([Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 内学堂) is a private museum of [Buddhist art](/wiki/Buddhist_art) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It is the first home museum in Singapore. The museum was created by collector Woon Wee Teng under a program enacted by the Singapore government to allow collectors to show their collections in their own homes. Opened in 2005, the collection is located in a four-storey pre-war house built in the [Peranakan](/wiki/Peranakan) style on [Cantonment Road](/wiki/Cantonment_Road,_Singapore). It is Singapore's first home museum. The museum is by invitation only. Singaporean billionaire businessman, [Oei Hong Leong](/wiki/Oei_Hong_Leong), houses most of his 50,000-piece collection of Buddhist artifacts at the Museum. In 2007, Woon announced plans for a much larger museum to house more Buddhist artifacts. Oei subsequently bought the museum but decided not to expand the museum. - [List of museums in Singapore](/wiki/List_of_museums_in_Singapore) - [Japanese sculpture](/wiki/Japanese_sculpture) - [Khmer sculpture](/wiki/Khmer_sculpture) - [Korean Buddhist sculpture](/wiki/Korean_Buddhist_sculpture) - [Lao Buddhist sculpture](/wiki/Lao_Buddhist_sculpture) - [Thai art](/wiki/Thai_art) - [Thai Buddhist sculpture](/wiki/Thai_Buddhist_sculpture) - Official website 1°16′30″N 103°50′20″E﻿ / ﻿1.2751°N 103.8390°E﻿ / 1.2751; 103.8390 This article about a Singapore building or structure is a stub.
