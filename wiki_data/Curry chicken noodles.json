  "content": "Singaporean noodle dish **Curry chicken noodle** is a Singaporean dish. It uses [curry](/wiki/Curry) as soup base coupled with yellow [noodles](/wiki/Noodles). Some stores will use [rice noodles](/wiki/Rice_noodles) instead. The dish usually contains [chicken](/wiki/Chicken_(food)) meat and tau pok. Additional ingredients may include [potatoes](/wiki/Potatoes) or other dishes, depending on stores. Curry plays an important part in this dish. Usually a more watery curry base is preferred so that the noodles are not hard to swallow. This [Singaporean cuisine](/wiki/Singaporean_cuisine)-related article is a stub.
