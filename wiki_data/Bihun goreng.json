  "content": "Southeast Asian fried rice vermicelli dish ***Bihun goreng***, ***bee hoon goreng*** or ***mee hoon goreng*** refers to a dish of [fried noodles](/wiki/Fried_noodles) cooked with [rice vermicelli](/wiki/Rice_vermicelli) in both the [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_language) and [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) languages. In certain countries, such as Singapore, the term *goreng* is occasionally substituted with its English equivalent for the name of the dish. There is no single defined recipe for the dish, and its composition and preparation varies greatly from household to household in all relevant cultural and linguistic regions, which may include vegetarian versions. ## Variants ### Indonesia In [Indonesian cuisine](/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine), *bihun goreng* is associated with [Chinese Indonesian](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian_cuisine) and [Javanese cuisine](/wiki/Javanese_cuisine). Like [mie goreng](/wiki/Mie_goreng) or [kwetiau goreng](/wiki/Kwetiau_goreng), bihun goreng is usually seasoned with *kecap manis* ([sweet soy sauce](/wiki/Sweet_soy_sauce)) and [*bumbu*](/wiki/Bumbu_(seasoning)). Typical ingredients involved in its preparation include [garlic](/wiki/Garlic), [onion](/wiki/Onion) or [shallots](/wiki/Shallot), fried [prawn](/wiki/Shrimp_and_prawn_as_food), [chicken](/wiki/Chicken_(food)), [beef](/wiki/Beef), or sliced [bakso](/wiki/Bakso) ([meatballs](/wiki/Meatball)), chili, [Chinese cabbage](/wiki/Chinese_cabbage), [cabbages](/wiki/Cabbage), [tomatoes](/wiki/Tomato), [egg](/wiki/Egg_(food)), and other vegetables. The dish may be accompanied with [acar](/wiki/Acar) and garnished with [fried shallots](/wiki/Fried_shallots). There are two distinct varieties—one is [Chinese Indonesian](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian_cuisine) version which does not use sweet soy sauce, the other is the Javanese version which does use sweet soy sauce. Bihun goreng with sweet soy sauce has that sweet and savoury flavour with smoky aroma. The Chinese Indonesian version however, uses no sweet soy sauce, thus similar to common Chinese-style stir fried rice vermicelli, akin to Singaporean fried *bee hoon*. In Indonesia *bihun goreng* might be consumed solely as a main dish, or served as an addition or topping in other dish, such as add upon *[nasi uduk](/wiki/Nasi_uduk)* (fragrant [coconut rice](/wiki/Coconut_rice)) or *[nasi campur](/wiki/Nasi_campur)* (mixed rice). ### Malaysia Noteworthy variants of the dish found in Malaysia include *bihun goreng utara* or Northern-style fried rice vermicelli, which refers to its prevalence in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia. A popular breakfast food and snack, it is fried to a dry texture, and seasoned with chilli powder and chives. ### Singapore In Singapore, rice vermicelli is locally known and spelled as *bee hoon*, *mee hoon*, or *mai fun*. The dish is generally prepared mild without any spicy seasonings, and is a popular option for breakfast. ## Gallery - Food portal - Indonesia portal - Malaysia portal - Singapore portal - [Kwetiau goreng](/wiki/Kwetiau_goreng) - [Mee goreng](/wiki/Mee_goreng) - [Mee siam](/wiki/Mee_siam) - [Mie goreng](/wiki/Mie_goreng) - [Pancit](/wiki/Pancit) - [Singapore-style noodles](/wiki/Singapore-style_noodles) - [Rice noodles](/wiki/Rice_noodles) - [Rice vermicelli](/wiki/Rice_vermicelli)\n",
