  "content": "Southeast Asian dish **Asam pedas** ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) for \"sour spicy\"; Malay pronunciation: [ˌasam pəˈdas]) is a traditional [sour](/wiki/Taste) and [spicy](/wiki/Pungency) *[gulai](/wiki/Gulai)* commonly found in [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia), particularly in [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia) and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). The dish is typically associated with [Malay](/wiki/Malay_cuisine), [Minangkabau](/wiki/Padang_cuisine), [Acehnese](/wiki/Acehnese_cuisine) and [Peranakan cuisines](/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine), and is prepared using various types of [seafood](/wiki/Seafood) or [freshwater fish](/wiki/Freshwater_fish). The broth is made with a combination of [chillies](/wiki/Chili_pepper) and [spices](/wiki/Spice), with the sour element derived from ingredients such as [tamarind](/wiki/Tamarind), *asam keping* (dried *[Garcinia](/wiki/Garcinia)* slices) or [lime](/wiki/Lime_(fruit)) juice, depending on regional variations. Regional names for the dish include *asam padeh* ([Minangkabau](/wiki/Minangkabau_language)), *asam keueung* ([Acehnese](/wiki/Acehnese_language)) and *gerang asam* ([Baba Malay](/wiki/Malay_trade_and_creole_languages) or Peranakan). The development of *asam pedas* is commonly associated with several regions of [maritime Southeast Asia](/wiki/Maritime_Southeast_Asia), notably the historic [trading port](/wiki/Entrep%C3%B4t) of [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca_City) in the [Malay Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula) and the [Minangkabau heartlands](/wiki/Minangkabau_people) of [West Sumatra](/wiki/West_Sumatra). These areas contributed to the evolution of the dish through long-standing [cultural exchanges](/wiki/Cultural_diplomacy) and [regional trade networks](/wiki/Regional_integration). Influences from various culinary traditions led to the adaptation of local ingredients and cooking methods, resulting in distinct regional expressions of the dish. Today, *asam pedas* remains a widely prepared dish across [Peninsular Malaysia](/wiki/Peninsular_Malaysia), [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra), [Borneo](/wiki/Borneo) and the [Riau Archipelago](/wiki/Riau_Archipelago). The variations in ingredients, preparation techniques and flavour profiles across these areas reflect the diverse cultural and geographical contexts that have shaped its development. ## Historical and cultural origins *Asam pedas* is part of the shared culinary heritage of both [Malay](/wiki/Malay_cuisine) and [Minangkabau](/wiki/Padang_cuisine) traditions, making its exact origin unclear. One theory suggests that ''Asam pedas'' originated in the [port city](/wiki/Port) of [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca_City), where maritime trade facilitated contact between local, Chinese and Portuguese communities. These interactions are believed to have influenced the development of the dish, particularly through the introduction of [tamarind](/wiki/Tamarind), which imparts a sour flavour, and the use of chilli, lemongrass and turmeric as key seasonings. Asam pedas also shows influences from [Peranakan](/wiki/Peranakan_Chinese) (Baba-Nyonya) cuisine, which incorporates elements of [Malay](/wiki/Malay_cuisine) and [Chinese culinary traditions](/wiki/Chinese_cuisine).[*better source needed*] The dish is also associated with the [Minangkabau people](/wiki/Minangkabau_people) of [West Sumatra](/wiki/West_Sumatra) in Indonesia, where a similar preparation known as *asam padeh* is part of traditional Minangkabau cuisine. This version, known for its sour and spicy flavour profile, is widely prepared in [Padang restaurants](/wiki/Nasi_padang). These establishments, which specialise in Minangkabau dishes, are common throughout Indonesia and also present in parts of Malaysia and Singapore, helping to popularise the dish beyond its original context. The spread of *asam pedas* has also been linked to the extensive maritime [trade routes](/wiki/Trade_route) and cultural exchanges among Malay-speaking populations throughout the [Malay Archipelago](/wiki/Malay_Archipelago). Today, it is commonly prepared in regions such as [Jambi](/wiki/Jambi), [Riau](/wiki/Riau), the [Riau Islands](/wiki/Riau_Islands), [Aceh](/wiki/Aceh), [Johore](/wiki/Johor), [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), and parts of [Borneo](/wiki/Borneo), particularly [Pontianak](/wiki/Pontianak) in [West Kalimantan](/wiki/West_Kalimantan). While the core elements often include fish [simmered](/wiki/Simmering) in a sour and spicy [broth](/wiki/Broth), the choice of souring agents such as tamarind, asam kandis or lime juice and other ingredients varies across regions ## Culinary characteristics *Asam pedas* is traditionally prepared using [seafood](/wiki/Seafood) or [freshwater fish](/wiki/Freshwater_fish) simmered in a sour tamarind-based broth flavoured with chillies and a blend of spices. While tamarind pulp, usually soaked in water and strained to extract its juice, is the most common souring agent, commercial [tamarind paste](/wiki/Paste_(food)) is also used as a convenient alternative. Some regional variations instead use *asam kandis* (*[Garcinia xanthochymus](/wiki/Garcinia_xanthochymus)*) or *asam sunti*, a [sun-dried](/wiki/Food_drying) and [salted form](/wiki/Salting_(food)) of *bilimbi* (*[Averrhoa bilimbi](/wiki/Averrhoa_bilimbi)*), to achieve a similar [tangy profile](/wiki/Taste#Sourness). Key ingredients often include [onion](/wiki/Onion), [ginger](/wiki/Ginger), [chilli paste](/wiki/Chili_sauce_and_paste), [turmeric](/wiki/Turmeric), fermented [shrimp paste](/wiki/Shrimp_paste), salt, *daun kesum* (*[Persicaria odorata](/wiki/Persicaria_odorata)*) and water. Vegetables such as [brinjals](/wiki/Eggplant), [okra](/wiki/Okra) and [tomatoes](/wiki/Tomato) are frequently added to enhance the flavour and texture of the stew. The types of fish used in *asam pedas* vary widely and include [mackerel](/wiki/Mackerel), [mackerel tuna](/wiki/Euthynnus_affinis) (*Euthynnus affinis*), [tuna](/wiki/Tuna), [skipjack tuna](/wiki/Skipjack_tuna), red snapper, [gourami](/wiki/Gourami), [pangasius](/wiki/Pangasius), [hemibagrus](/wiki/Hemibagrus) and [cuttlefish](/wiki/Cuttlefish). These may be cooked whole or with only the [fish heads](/wiki/Fish_head) included to create a spicy and sour fish stew. To maintain the fish's integrity and presentation, it is generally added towards the end of the cooking process. This method ensures the fish remains intact when served, preserving both its appearance and texture. ### Regional variations and culinary significance #### Malay Peninsula and Singapore The preparation of *asam pedas* varies significantly across regions, reflecting local tastes, available ingredients and culinary traditions. In [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca), the dish tends to have a more [soupy consistency](/wiki/Soup) while retaining its signature sour and spicy flavour profile. This version is typically prepared with [fenugreek](/wiki/Fenugreek) seeds (halba), [cumin](/wiki/Cumin) seeds (jintan), [candlenuts](/wiki/Candlenut) (buah keras) and [galangal](/wiki/Galangal), with [kaffir lime](/wiki/Kaffir_lime) leaves often used as an aromatic in place of daun kesum. The [Peranakan](/wiki/Peranakan_Chinese) version, commonly known as gerang asam ikan, is distinguished by its deeper use of root spices compared to the [Malay preparations](/wiki/Malay_cuisine). It typically features fresh whole fish simmered with tamarind, chillies and herbs like daun kesum. Some recipes may include bunga kantan ([torch ginger](/wiki/Etlingera_elatior)), though this is sometimes avoided by traditional cooks who prefer to retain the dish's original herbal balance. In [Johor](/wiki/Johor), regional variations also emerge. In the southern part of the state, *asam pedas* is prepared with a thicker, more robust gravy, often enhanced with [black pepper](/wiki/Black_pepper) and occasionally pickled [mustard leaves](/wiki/Mustard_seed) (sawi masin) to intensify its sourness. Conversely, northern Johor localities such as [Tangkak](/wiki/Tangkak), [Muar](/wiki/Muar_(town)), [Batu Pahat](/wiki/Batu_Pahat_District) and [Kluang](/wiki/Kluang) favour a thinner consistency and typically exclude black pepper. A common adaptation known as *asam pedas ayam* replaces fish with [chicken](/wiki/Chicken), offering a variation on the traditional base. Within the [Melayu-Bugis](/wiki/Bugis-Malay) community of Johor, *asam pedas* is also called *nasu metti*. It is traditionally served alongside [rice cakes](/wiki/Rice_cake) such as *[burasak](/wiki/Burasa)* and *lepat lui*, especially during festive occasions like [Eid](/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr), reflecting the cultural continuity of Bugis-Malay traditions in the region. In [Kedah](/wiki/Kedah), the dish exhibits strong [Thai culinary influences](/wiki/Thai_cuisine) and is often prepared with freshwater fish. Sourness is derived from a variety of agents including tamarind juice, *asam keping* (dried slices of [Garcinia atroviridis](/wiki/Garcinia_atroviridis)), or lime juice. The spice blend commonly features cumin seeds, contributing to the dish's distinctive aromatic profile. #### Sumatra A regional variation in [Riau](/wiki/Riau), known as *asam pedas ikan baung*, uses baung fish ([Hemibagrus nemurus](/wiki/Hemibagrus_nemurus)), which is marinated with *asam kandis* or tamarind to reduce its odour and impart a distinctive sourness to the broth. In the [Riau Archipelago](/wiki/Riau_Archipelago), particularly in [Lingga](/wiki/Lingga_Regency), *asam pedas* is traditionally served with *lempeng sagu*, a flat [sago cake](/wiki/Sago) made by roasting sago flour with [grated coconut](/wiki/Coconut) and seasoning. This accompaniment, which dates back to the [Riau-Lingga Sultanate](/wiki/Riau-Lingga_Sultanate) period, is commonly eaten for breakfast or during communal gatherings. Among the [Minangkabau people](/wiki/Minangkabau_people) of [West Sumatra](/wiki/West_Sumatra), a related dish called *asam padeh daging* substitutes fish with [beef](/wiki/Beef) as the primary protein. The dish is known for its sour and spicy broth, commonly flavoured with *asam kandis* (*[Garcinia xanthochymus](/wiki/Garcinia_xanthochymus)*). While beef remains the conventional ingredient, contemporary variations may incorporate fish or chicken. Asam padeh daging is a staple in [Padang restaurants](/wiki/Nasi_padang) and frequently served at ceremonial events. In [Aceh](/wiki/Aceh), a similar sour and spicy dish known as *asam keueng*, also referred to as *asam pedas Aceh*, represents a regional adaptation of the broader *asam pedas* tradition. Its distinctive sourness is derived from *asam sunti*, a preserved form of sun-dried and salted *belimbing wuluh* ([bilimbi](/wiki/Averrhoa_bilimbi)). The broth, typically enriched with turmeric, chillies and local spices, is commonly served with seafood such as mackerel tuna, prawns or other locally available fish varieties. ## Local variations - Food portal - Indonesia portal - Malaysia portal - Singapore portal - [Gulai](/wiki/Gulai) - [Kaeng som](/wiki/Kaeng_som) - [Pindang](/wiki/Pindang) - [Fish stew](/wiki/Fish_stew) - [List of fish dishes](/wiki/List_of_fish_dishes) - [List of stews](/wiki/List_of_stews)\n",
