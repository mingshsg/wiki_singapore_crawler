Arab Street can refer to both the street name as well as the surrounding area, which is typically considered to include other surrounding streets, such as but not limited to [Bussorah Street](/wiki/Bussorah_Street), [Haji Lane](/wiki/Haji_Lane), Bali Lane and Muscat Street. Today, it is a considered a historical site with many conserved shophouses in the area. ## Etymology There are two possible explanations for how the name came about: 1. One possible explanation was that an Arab merchant Syed Ali bin Mohamed Al Junied used to own the whole area, hence the choice of name; 2. Another possible explanation can be traced to [Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles)' instructions as part of the [Jackson Plan](/wiki/Jackson_Plan) (also known as the Raffles Town Plan) to allocate the Kampong Glam area to both the [Bugis](/wiki/Bugis) (who had already previously settled there) as well as the Arabs. ## Notable landmarks - [Masjid Sultan](/wiki/Sultan_Mosque) - [The Projector](/wiki/The_Projector) - [Malay Heritage Centre](/wiki/Malay_Heritage_Centre) 1°18′8.1″N 103°51′29.6″E﻿ / ﻿1.302250°N 103.858222°E﻿ / 1.302250; 103.858222 This Singapore road article is a stub.
