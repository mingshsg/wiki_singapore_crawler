Having signed his first professional contract at [Vicarage Road](/wiki/Vicarage_Road) in July 2013, he was then called up by the first team to the pre-season friendly tour in Italy after he impressed staff during training. O'Nien was then given the number 32 shirt. He had been an unused substitute on a handful of occasions during the [2013–14 season](/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_Watford_F.C._season). He made his Watford debut as an 88th-minute substitute in a 3–0 win at home to [Barnsley](/wiki/Barnsley_F.C.) on 15 March 2014. After the match, O'Nien reacted to his debut against Barnsley, saying \"It was fantastic to get out there, that’s what you work towards, and I’ll keep on practising\". #### Wealdstone (loan) On 27 March 2014, O'Nien signed a one-month loan deal with [Isthmian League Premier Division](/wiki/Isthmian_League) side [Wealdstone](/wiki/Wealdstone_F.C.). He made his debut as a late substitute in a win over [Billericay Town](/wiki/Billericay_Town_F.C.) on 31 March 2014, while his first start came three days later on 3 April 2014 in a 3–0 success over [East Thurrock United](/wiki/East_Thurrock_United_F.C.). He ended the season gaining a Ryman Premier Division title medal as Wealdstone won the league. Following his loan spell, on 13 May 2014, O'Nien signed a new one-year deal with the *Hornets*. He expressed delight over signing a new contract with the club. In August 2014, O'Nien returned to Wealdstone, now a [Conference South](/wiki/Football_Conference) side, on a season-long loan deal. Following Watford's promotion to the [Premier League](/wiki/Premier_League) in 2015, O'Nien was one of three released by the club following the expiration of his contract. ### Wycombe Wanderers On 25 July 2015, O'Nien signed for [League Two](/wiki/Football_League_Two) side [Wycombe Wanderers](/wiki/Wycombe_Wanderers_F.C.) on a one-year deal, having had a successful trial with the club. He scored the first professional goal of his career on 3 October 2015, as Wycombe took the lead after just 70 seconds, in a 3–2 defeat at home to [Northampton](/wiki/Northampton_Town_F.C.). Following the match, O'Nien thanked his former manager at Wealdstone, [Gordon Bartlett](/wiki/Gordon_Bartlett), and said \"I would recommend a move to that level for any youngster trying to make it in the [Football League](/wiki/Football_League). It is a good platform to learn and to build from.\" In 2017, he earned the accolade of Community Player of the Season. In the [2017–18 season](/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_Wycombe_Wanderers_F.C._season), the club won promotion to [League One](/wiki/Football_League_One), after defeating [Chesterfield](/wiki/Chesterfield_F.C.) 2–1 to secure the final automatic promotion place. ### Sunderland O'Nien joined [Sunderland](/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C.) on 30 July 2018. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–0 win away to [Shrewsbury Town](/wiki/Shrewsbury_Town_F.C.) on 20 October 2018. His second goal for the club came on 27 November 2018, and it was Sunderland's fourth, and final, goal of an entertaining 4–2 home victory against promotion rivals Barnsley. In March 2019, he had consistent performances in an unfamiliar [right back](/wiki/Right_back) role in which he won multiple [man of the match](/wiki/Man_of_the_match) awards. At the end of the [2018–19 season](/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Sunderland_A.F.C._season), O'Nien picked up the award of Young Player of The Year award. In the [2019 League One play-offs](/wiki/2019_English_Football_League_play-offs#League_One_semi-finals), O'Nien was attacked by a Portsmouth fan at [Fratton Park](/wiki/Fratton_Park) after he was accidentally pushed into the stands by a player on the opposing team. O'Nien appeared to get punched, kicked and hurled abuse at by nearby Portsmouth fans. However, O'Nien wasn't injured and did not press charges, saying it was \"just a bit of handbags\". Following an impressive [2020–21 season](/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_Sunderland_A.F.C._season), O'Nien was named in the [2020–21 EFL League One Team of the Season](/wiki/EFL_Awards) at the league's annual awards ceremony on 29 April 2021. On 6 July 2021, O'Nien signed a new three-year contract extension with [Sunderland](/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C.). Ahead of the [2024–25 season](/wiki/2024%E2%80%9325_Sunderland_A.F.C._season), O'Nien was named as Sunderland's [club captain](/wiki/Club_captain). In the opening weekend of the new season, he scored against [Cardiff City](/wiki/Cardiff_City_F.C.) for his first goal of the campaign. O'Nien found the net again the following week, along with bagging an assist, making it three goal contributions in two games. He scored an [own goal](/wiki/Own_goal) while attempting to turn his head to dodge the ball while facing [Portsmouth](/wiki/Portsmouth_F.C.) on Matchday 4. This own goal ended Sunderland's 389-minute run without conceding a goal. On 24 May 2025, Sunderland ended their eight-year wait to return to the [Premier League](/wiki/Premier_League) after beating [Sheffield United](/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.) 2–1 with an injury-time winner in the [Championship play-off final](/wiki/2025_EFL_Championship_play-off_final). O'Nien, who had to watch the rest of the match from the sidelines after dislocating his shoulder during the game, joked that he \"covered more distance celebrating\". After the match, he told [Sky Sports](/wiki/Sky_Sports) that he had \"never had anxiety like it\", but that he was \"so proud of these boys\". On 14 August 2025, O'Nien signed a new two-year contract, with a club option of a further year. On 3 December, O'Nien made his [Premier League](/wiki/Premier_League) debut in a 1–1 draw against [Liverpool](/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) at [Anfield](/wiki/Anfield), replacing goalscorer [Chemsdine Talbi](/wiki/Chemsdine_Talbi). ## Personal life O'Nien was born in [Hemel Hempstead](/wiki/Hemel_Hempstead), [Hertfordshire](/wiki/Hertfordshire).
