  "content": "English actress (1927–2020) **Heather Jean Chasen** (20 July 1927 – 22 May 2020) was an English actress, known for her roles in soap operas; playing Valerie Pollard in the [ITV](/wiki/ITV_Network) soap opera, *[Crossroads](/wiki/Crossroads_(British_TV_series))*, from 1982 to 1986 and guest roles in *[Doctors](/wiki/Doctors_(2000_TV_series))*, *[Holby City](/wiki/Holby_City)* and *[Family Affairs](/wiki/Family_Affairs)*. Chasen also played many roles in [BBC Radio 2](/wiki/BBC_Radio_2)'s *[The Navy Lark](/wiki/The_Navy_Lark)* from 1959 to 1977, and appeared in the television series *[Marked Personal](/wiki/Marked_Personal)* from 1973 to 1974. She played the recurring role of [Lydia Simmonds](/wiki/Lydia_Simmonds) in the [BBC](/wiki/BBC) soap opera *[EastEnders](/wiki/EastEnders)*, a role which received positive reviews from critics and *EastEnders* crew and cast members. Furthermore, she appeared extensively in theatre productions and film; in 2012, she appeared in a film version of *[Les Misérables](/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables_(2012_film))*. ## Early life Chasen was born on 20 July 1927, in [Singapore](/wiki/British_Singapore) to Agnes H. (née McCullock) and [F.N. Chasen](/wiki/Frederick_Nutter_Chasen), an English [ornithologist](/wiki/Ornithologist). Her father fought as a [trooper](/wiki/Trooper_(rank)) with the [Norfolk Yeomanry](/wiki/Norfolk_Yeomanry) in [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I). In 1921, he left England to work at the [Raffles Library and Museum](/wiki/National_Museum_of_Singapore) in Singapore, marrying Chasen's mother, Agnes, in 1926. Chasen's sister, Christine Elizabeth, was born on 4 May 1931. Her parents split up in 1938, and both later remarried. Before the [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_people) occupation, which led to the [Battle of Singapore](/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore) during [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II), Chasen and her mother left Singapore on the last boat before the occupation. Her father, however, on a separate ship, HMS *Giang Bee*, died when it was sunk by the Japanese on 12 February 1942. Chasen's stepfather, G.C.R. Franks, also died in fighting, on 22 March. Chasen and her mother moved to the UK and she trained at the [Royal Academy of Dramatic Art](/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Dramatic_Art), where she acted on stage and went on tour with [Frankie Howerd](/wiki/Frankie_Howerd) in *Hotel Paradiso*. She appeared with [Sybil Thorndike](/wiki/Dame_Sybil_Thorndike) in *Call Me Jacky*, and toured with [Douglas Fairbanks Jr.](/wiki/Douglas_Fairbanks_Jr.) in *The Pleasure of his Company*, in [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto). ## Career ### *Crossroads* and *EastEnders* > I did an episode where I played this journalist which they must have quite liked because they got back to me about a month later. [They asked me] 'Would you come back and join the cast and change the colour of your hair?' Well, I said okay and so I changed my [hair] colour from red to blonde and I looked exactly the same! I didn't look any different at all. And so then I came back as this naughty lady, Valerie Pollard. The most fun I had was when I was helping out behind the bar which is a very good place to be if you're in a soap because you're in every scene. I was very happy, it was a fun time, I enjoyed it. At the beginning, not at the very end. When I first joined it, for the first few months I was in, it was great fun but after Jack (the producer) went it became less good and less fun and I didn't enjoy it so much\". — Chasen describing her time on *Crossroads*, from 1982 to 1986 In 2011, Chasen was cast as [Lydia Simmonds](/wiki/Lydia_Simmonds), [Janine Butcher](/wiki/Janine_Butcher) ([Charlie Brooks](/wiki/Charlie_Brooks))'s maternal grandmother and [Norman Simmonds'](/wiki/Norman_Simmonds) ([George Layton](/wiki/George_Layton)) mother, in the [BBC](/wiki/BBC) soap opera *[EastEnders](/wiki/EastEnders)*, after the original actress [Margaret Tyzack](/wiki/Margaret_Tyzack) had to pull out of the role for personal reasons. Two episodes featuring Tyzack had already been broadcast, and she featured in a further one on 14 April. Chasen was cast and replaced Tyzack in the role, beginning filming on 15 April for scenes broadcast from 21 April. *EastEnders*' executive producer, [Bryan Kirkwood](/wiki/Bryan_Kirkwood), added: \"In order to continue the current storyline we've taken the decision for Heather Chasen to take over the role of Lydia.\" The character died on-screen and Chasen made her last appearance on 13 June 2011, and, though not credited for it, did a voice-over for the 14 and 28 June episodes. Kirkwood later said \"Lydia's storyline was perfect\" and that Chasen had made the part her own after Tyzack's departure. Brooks said of the storyline as a whole, \"I absolutely loved exploring Janine's background. I was really proud with the scenes with Heather Chasen [Lydia]. It was really hard work, but worth it.\" ### Other work Chasen appeared in other television programmes such as *[The Bill](/wiki/The_Bill)* and *[The Harry Hill Show](/wiki/The_Harry_Hill_Show)*. She had guest roles in *[Z-Cars](/wiki/Z-Cars)* and *[Dixon of Dock Green](/wiki/Dixon_of_Dock_Green)* and voiced a number of characters in the radio show *[The Navy Lark](/wiki/The_Navy_Lark)*, particularly WREN Heather Chasen and \"battle axe\" Ramona Povey.

In *Call Me Jacky*, she played an alcoholic lesbian, and later claimed to have based her characterisation partly on the novelist and playwright [Patricia Highsmith](/wiki/Patricia_Highsmith), whom she knew well.
