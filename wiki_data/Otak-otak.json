  "content": "Indonesian traditional fish cake ***Otak-otak*** (lit. [brains](/wiki/Brain) in [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) and [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_language); [Thai](/wiki/Thai_language): โอตัก-โอตัก) is a [Southeast Asian](/wiki/Southeast_Asia) [fish cake](/wiki/Fish_cake) made of ground [fish](/wiki/Fish_(food)) mixed with spices and wrapped in leaf parcels. *Otak-otak* is traditionally served steamed or grilled, encased within the leaf parcel it is cooked in, and can be eaten solely as a snack or with [steamed rice](/wiki/Steamed_rice) as part of a meal. The earliest preparations of *otak-otak* are believed to have originated in [Palembang cuisine](/wiki/Palembang_cuisine) of [South Sumatra](/wiki/South_Sumatra), where it takes the form of grilled [banana leaf](/wiki/Banana_leaf) parcels filled with a mixture of ground fish, [tapioca](/wiki/Tapioca) starch and spices. Regional varieties which bear the name *otak-otak* are widely known across Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries, though they may have little in common with the Palembang version. In Singapore and southern Malaysia, the reddish-orange or brown colour of its contents is acquired from [chili](/wiki/Chili_powder), [turmeric](/wiki/Turmeric) and other spices. ## Origins and distribution *Otak-otak* is widely spread on both sides of the [Straits of Malacca](/wiki/Straits_of_Malacca). It is believed that the dish was a fusion of [Malay](/wiki/Malay_Indonesian) ([Palembangese](/wiki/Palembangese_people)) and [Peranakan](/wiki/Peranakan) origins. In Indonesia, the name of the dish is said to be derived from the notion that the [Palembang *otak-otak*](/wiki/Palembang_cuisine) resembles [brain matter](/wiki/Brain_matter_(disambiguation)): the mixture of ground fish meat and tapioca starch is whitish grey, soft and almost squishy. From Palembang, it is believed to have spread to the islands of [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra), [Java](/wiki/Java), and the rest of the [Malay Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula). Three Indonesian cities are famous for their *otak-otak*: [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang), [Jakarta](/wiki/Jakarta) and [Makassar](/wiki/Makassar). In [Bangka island](/wiki/Bangka_Island), the town of Belinyu is famous as a production center of *otak-otak*. The town of [Muar](/wiki/Muar_(town)), [Johor](/wiki/Johor) located south of West Peninsular Malaysia is renowned for its version of *otak-otak*. It is a culinary attraction for tourists from surrounding states and neighbouring Singapore, where the dish is known as *otah* or 烏打 in Chinese. ## Composition *Otak-otak* is made by mixing [fish paste](/wiki/Fish_paste) with a mixture of spices. The type of fish used to make *otak-otak* might vary: [mackerel](/wiki/Mackerel_as_food) is commonly used in Malaysia, while *ikan tenggiri* ([wahoo](/wiki/Wahoo)) is popular ingredient in Indonesia. Other types of fish such as *bandeng* ([milkfish](/wiki/Milkfish)) and the more expensive *ikan belida* ([featherback](/wiki/Featherback) fish) might be used. In Indonesia, the mixture typically contains fish paste, [shallots](/wiki/Shallot), garlic, [scallions](/wiki/Scallion), [egg](/wiki/Egg_(food)), [coconut milk](/wiki/Coconut_milk), and [sago](/wiki/Sago) or [tapioca](/wiki/Tapioca) starch. In Jakarta, Indonesia, one finds *otak-otak* being sold in small stalls near bus stops, especially during afternoon rush hour. In Makassar, the main ingredient is fresh king mackerel fish, also called king fish or [Spanish mackerel](/wiki/Spanish_mackerel). In Malaysia, it is usually a mixture between fish paste, [chili peppers](/wiki/Chili_pepper), garlic, shallots, [turmeric](/wiki/Turmeric), [lemongrass](/wiki/Lemongrass) and coconut milk. The mixture is then wrapped in either banana, coconut or nipa palm leaf that has been softened by steaming, then grilled or steamed. ## Regional varieties There are different varieties of *otak-otak* originating from different regions. Although *otak-otak* is traditionally made with fish meat, modern versions of *otak-otak* may use [crab](/wiki/Crab_meat) or [prawn](/wiki/Shrimp_and_prawn_as_food) meat or fish heads. In Indonesia, *otak-otak* is commonly associated with [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang), South [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra). However, other regions in Indonesia are also known for their *otak-otak* recipes, such as [Jakarta](/wiki/Jakarta) and [Makassar](/wiki/Makassar). In Palembang, people eat *otak-otak* with *cuko* (Palembangese sweet and sour spicy vinegar sauce), while across the strait on [Bangka Belitung](/wiki/Bangka_Belitung) islands, the slightly different sour *cuko* sauce is made with a mixture of vinegar, shrimp paste and [fermented soybean paste](/wiki/Tauco). In Jakarta and Makassar, it is enjoyed with spicy [peanut sauce](/wiki/Peanut_sauce). In [Tanjungpinang](/wiki/Tanjungpinang), [Bintan Island](/wiki/Bintan_Island), *otak-otak* is generally made from fish and cuttlefish meat; also typical of this area is the use of fish bones. It is mixed with spices and wrapped using coconut leaves. The *otak-otak* from southern Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore is wrapped up as a thin slice using banana or coconut leaf and grilled over a charcoal fire. As a result, it ends up drier and with a more distinct smoky fish aroma. Unlike the pale white colouration of most Indonesian *otak-otak*, *otak-otak* from Malaysia and Singapore is reddish-orange from the use of chilli paste and often heavily spiced. Muar-style *otak-otak* is wrapped inside *attap* ([nipa palm](/wiki/Nipa_palm)) leaves and clipped using a stapler or toothpick at both ends before being grilled or roasted on the stove. While fish *otak-otak* is most common, Muar-style *otak-otak* may also be made with prawns, [cuttlefish](/wiki/Cuttlefish), crab meat, fish heads and [chicken](/wiki/Chicken_(food)). Besides being wrapped and grilled in *attap* leaf parcels, Muar-style *otak-otak* may be steamed as an alternative cooking method. [Peranakan](/wiki/Peranakan)-style *otak-otak* (Malay: *otak-otak Nyonya*) from the northern Malaysian state of [Penang](/wiki/Penang) is prepared with a mixture of ground fish, eggs, and herbs, wrapped in [banana leaves](/wiki/Banana_leaves) before steaming. In the Philippines, [Tausūg people](/wiki/Taus%C5%ABg_people) created *utak-utak* made of shredded tuna meat mixed with spices and grated coconut, then fried in vegetable oil. ## Similar dishes A dish similar to *otak-otak* from the Malaysian state of [Terengganu](/wiki/Terengganu) is called *[sata](/wiki/Sata_(food))*. A similar Indonesian dish employing banana leaf is called [pepes](/wiki/Pepes). Other types of *otak-otak* include dishes called *pais ikan*, *[botok](/wiki/Botok)* that are made of fish paste cooked in banana leaves. The northern Philippine province of [Pangasinan](/wiki/Pangasinan) has a similar dish called *[tupig](/wiki/Tupig)*, which is cooked in the same manner as *otak-otak*, though *tupig* is sweetened. A thick batter made of glutinous rice flour (known locally as *galapong*), coconut strips, coconut milk, sugar and nuts is wrapped in banana leaves, and then grilled over coals. - Food portal - Indonesia portal - Malaysia portal - Singapore portal - [Malay cuisine](/wiki/Malay_cuisine) - [Peranakan cuisine](/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine) - [Szczecin paprikas](/wiki/Szczecin_paprikas) - [Pempek](/wiki/Pempek) - [Lekor](/wiki/Lekor) - [Tamale](/wiki/Tamale) - [Conkie](/wiki/Conkie) - Otak-otak Jakarta recipe - Otak-Otak Recipe - Terengganu government tourism – Otak-otak.\n",
