  "content": "Cantonese style of barbecued pork ***Char siu*** (t͡ʃɑ siu̯; *cha-SYEW*) ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 叉燒; [Cantonese Yale](/wiki/Yale_romanization_of_Cantonese): *chāsīu*) (literally meaning \"fork roasted\") is a [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese_cuisine)-style [barbecued](/wiki/Barbecue) pork. Originating in [Guangdong](/wiki/Guangdong), it is eaten with rice, used as an ingredient for noodle dishes or in stir fries, and as a filling for *[cha siu bao](/wiki/Cha_siu_bao)* or [pineapple buns](/wiki/Pineapple_bun#Other_common_variants). [Five-spice powder](/wiki/Five-spice_powder) is the primary spice, honey or other sweeteners are used as a glaze, and the characteristic red color comes from the [red yeast rice](/wiki/Red_yeast_rice) when made traditionally. It is classified as a type of *[siu mei](/wiki/Siu_mei)* (燒味), Cantonese roasted meat. ## Meat cuts Pork cuts used for *char siu* can vary, but a few main cuts are common: - [Pork loin](/wiki/Pork_loin) - [Pork belly](/wiki/Pork_belly) – produces juicy and fattier *char siu* - [Pork butt](/wiki/Pork_butt) (shoulder) – produces leaner *char siu* - [Pork fat](/wiki/Fatback) - Pork neck end – very marbled (*jyu geng yuk*) ## Cultural variations ### Cantonese cuisine In ancient times, wild boar and other available meats were used to make *char siu*. However, in modern times, the meat is typically a shoulder cut of domestic pork, seasoned with a mixture of [honey](/wiki/Honey), five-spice powder, [red fermented bean curd](/wiki/Fermented_bean_curd#Varieties), [dark soy sauce](/wiki/Dark_soy_sauce), [hoisin sauce](/wiki/Hoisin_sauce), red [food colouring](/wiki/Food_colouring) (not a traditional ingredient but very common in today's preparations and is optional), and [sherry](/wiki/Sherry) or [rice wine](/wiki/Huangjiu) (optional). These seasonings turn the exterior layer of the meat dark red, similar to the \"smoke ring\" of American barbecues. [Maltose](/wiki/Maltose) may be used to give char siu its characteristic shiny glaze. *Char siu* is typically consumed with a starch, whether inside a bun (*cha siu bao*, 叉燒包), with noodles (*chasiu min*, 叉燒麵), or with rice (*chasiu faan*, 叉燒飯) in fast food establishments, or served alone as a centerpiece or main dish in traditional family dining establishments. If it is purchased outside of a restaurant, it is usually taken home and used as one ingredient in various complex main courses consumed at family meals. The ovens used to roast char siu are usually large gas rotisseries. Since ovens are not standard in Hong Kong households, *char siu* is usually purchased from a *[siu mei](/wiki/Siu_mei)* establishment, which specialises in meat dishes such as *char siu*, [soy sauce chicken](/wiki/Soy_sauce_chicken), [white cut chicken](/wiki/White_cut_chicken), [roasted goose](/wiki/Roasted_goose), and [roasted pork](/wiki/Siu_yuk). These shops usually display the merchandise by hanging them in the window. ### Southeast Asian cuisine In Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam, *char siew* rice is found in many Chinese *shāolà* (燒臘 or 烧腊) stalls along with roast duck and roast pork. The dish consists of slices of *char siu*, [cucumbers](/wiki/Cucumbers), white rice and is drenched in sweet gravy or drizzled with dark [soy sauce](/wiki/Soy_sauce). *Char siu* rice is also a popular food within the Chinese community in [Medan](/wiki/Medan), [North Sumatra](/wiki/North_Sumatra), where it is more called *char sio*. In [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), *char siew* rice can also be found in [Hainanese chicken rice](/wiki/Hainanese_chicken_rice) stalls, where customers have a choice of having their *char siu* rice served with plain white rice or chicken-flavoured rice, and choose from garlic, chilli and soy sauces. In [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand), *char siu* is called *mu daeng* ([Thai](/wiki/Thai_language): หมูแดง, pronounced [mǔː dɛ̄ːŋ], \"red pork\") and in Cambodia it is called *sach chrouk sa seev* ([Khmer](/wiki/Khmer_language): សាច់ជ្រូកសាស៉ីវ, *sac cruuk sa səyv*). In the Philippines, it is known as Chinese pork *[asado](/wiki/Philippine_asado)*, but also referred to as *cha siu*. It is usually eaten with cold cuts or served stuffed in *[siopao](/wiki/Siopao)*. In Flanders and Holland, it is sometimes mistaken for the Chinese/Indonesian name '[babi panggang](/wiki/Babi_panggang)'. This is a different dish (mostly sweeter and served with yellow pickled Chinese cabbage, called atjar). In fact, these Chinese/Indo restaurants also sometimes serve cha(r) sieuw under the original name. ### Japanese cuisine [Japanese cuisine](/wiki/Japanese_cuisine) has adapted 叉燒 as *chāshū* (チャーシュー). Unlike its Cantonese variant, it is not roasted, but prepared by rolling pork belly into a log and then braising it at a low temperature. This type of braising is a Chinese technique known as [red cooking](/wiki/Red_cooking), which imparts a reddish-brown coloration. The Japanese adaptation is typically seasoned with soy sauce, [sake](/wiki/Sake), [mirin](/wiki/Mirin) and sugar or other sweetener, without the red food colouring, nor [five-spice powder](/wiki/Five-spice_powder) that characterizes char siu. It is a typical ingredient for toppings in *[rāmen](/wiki/Ramen)*. ### United Kingdom cuisine *Char siu* is the main ingredient in [jar jow](/wiki/Jar_jow), a once popular stir fry dish from [East London](/wiki/East_London). ## Gallery - Food portal - China portal - Indonesia portal - Malaysia portal - Singapore portal - Thailand portal - [Asado](/wiki/Asado) - [List of pork dishes](/wiki/List_of_pork_dishes) - [Red cooking](/wiki/Red_cooking) - [Siu mei](/wiki/Siu_mei) - [Lou mei](/wiki/Lou_mei)\n",
