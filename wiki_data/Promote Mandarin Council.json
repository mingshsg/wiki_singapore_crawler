  "content": "Singaporean language regulator of Mandarin The **Promote Mandarin Council** ([traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 推廣華語理事會; [simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 推广华语理事会; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *Tuīguǎng huáyǔ lǐshì huì*) is a [Singaporean](/wiki/Singapore) organisation established in 1979 as part of then-[PM](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew)'s [programme to promote Mandarin](/wiki/Speak_Mandarin_Campaign) as the preferred language amongst [Chinese Singaporeans](/wiki/Chinese_Singaporeans). ## Background In 1966 the [Singapore Government](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore) institutionalised a bilingual education policy, under which [Singaporean](/wiki/Singaporeans) students were required to learn both [English](/wiki/Singapore_English) and their \"designated mother-tongue\". For ethnic-[Chinese Singaporeans](/wiki/Chinese_Singaporeans), the designated language was [Mandarin](/wiki/Standard_Chinese), in line with the [national language](/wiki/National_language) policy pursued in both [Nationalist](/wiki/Taiwan) and [Communist China](/wiki/Mainland_China). The *Goh Report*, an evaluation of Singapore's education system by [Dr. Goh Keng Swee](/wiki/Goh_Keng_Swee), claimed that less than 40% of the student population managed to attain the minimum level of [competency](/wiki/Linguistic_competence) in two languages. The Government then alleged that learning of [Mandarin](/wiki/Standard_Chinese) amongst the [Singapore Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_Singaporeans) was hindered by the home use of various [varieties of Chinese](/wiki/Varieties_of_Chinese). These varieties included [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien), [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect), [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese) and [Hakka](/wiki/Hakka_Chinese). Since then, the [Singapore Government](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore) has pursued a hostile stance against these varieties, and has promoted the use of [Mandarin](/wiki/Standard_Chinese) as a universal mother-tongue amongst [Singapore Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_Singaporeans). ## Establishment In 1979, then-[PM](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) decided to establish the Promote Mandarin Commission as an organisation focused entirely on the promotion of the [Mandarin language](/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese), with the initial goal of eliminating all other [Chinese varieties](/wiki/Varieties_of_Chinese) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) within the next decade. In 1998, the Commission was officially renamed as the Promote Mandarin Council. - Official site\n",
