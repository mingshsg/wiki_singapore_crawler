  "content": "Former time zone **UTC+07:30** is an identifier for a [time offset from UTC](/wiki/UTC_offset) of +07:30. ## History UTC+07:30 was used both as [daylight saving time](/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) as well as [standard time](/wiki/Standard_time) later in [Malaya](/wiki/British_Malaya) (the [Malay peninsula](/wiki/Malay_peninsula)) and Singapore. Between 1941 and 1942 before the [Japanese occupation](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore), and from 1945 to 1965 after the occupation, Malaya and Singapore used UTC+07:30 as daylight saving time. It was later in 1965 when Singapore decided to declare UTC+07:30 as its standard time. The [Malaysian government](/wiki/Malaysian_Government) announced in December 1981 that it would adjust Peninsular Malaysia’s time by 30 minutes on 1 January 1982 in order to keep common time with [East Malaysia](/wiki/East_Malaysia). In view of Singapore’s close relations with Malaysia and also to prevent confusion for travellers and businessmen, the [Singapore government](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore) made a very quick decision to follow suit. UTC+08:00 is the current [time zone](/wiki/Time_zone) for Malaysia and Singapore and this standard time has been in use since 1982. - [Singapore Standard Time](/wiki/Singapore_Standard_Time) - [Time in Malaysia](/wiki/Time_in_Malaysia) - UTC+07:20 This [standards](/wiki/Standardization)- or [measurement](/wiki/Measurement)-related article is a stub.
