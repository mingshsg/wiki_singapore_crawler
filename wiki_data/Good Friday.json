  "content": "Christian holiday **Good Friday**, also known as **Holy Friday**, **Great Friday**, **Great and Holy Friday**, or **Friday of the Passion of the Lord**, is a solemn Christian holy day commemorating the [crucifixion of Jesus](/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus) and his death at [Calvary](/wiki/Calvary) (Golgotha). It is observed during [Holy Week](/wiki/Holy_Week) as part of the [Paschal Triduum](/wiki/Paschal_Triduum). Members of many [Christian denominations](/wiki/Christian_denominations), including the [Catholic](/wiki/Catholic), [Eastern Orthodox](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox), [Lutheran](/wiki/Lutheran), [Anglican](/wiki/Anglican), [Methodist](/wiki/Methodist), [Oriental Orthodox](/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox), [United Protestant](/wiki/United_Protestant) and some [Reformed traditions](/wiki/Reformed_tradition) (including certain [Continental Reformed](/wiki/Continental_Reformed), [Presbyterian](/wiki/Presbyterian) and [Congregationalist](/wiki/Congregationalist) churches), observe Good Friday with [fasting](/wiki/Fasting_in_religion#Christianity) and [church services](/wiki/Church_service). In many Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican and Methodist churches, the [Service of the Great Three Hours' Agony](/wiki/Three_Hours%27_Agony) is held from noon until 3 p.m.—the hours the [Bible](/wiki/Bible) records [darkness](/wiki/Crucifixion_darkness) covering the land until Jesus' death on the cross. In the Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican traditions of Christianity, the [Stations of the Cross](/wiki/Stations_of_the_Cross) are prayed in the evening of Good Friday, as with other Fridays of Lent. Communicants of the [Moravian Church](/wiki/Moravian_Church) have a Good Friday tradition of [cleaning gravestones in Moravian cemeteries](/wiki/God%27s_Acre). The [date of Good Friday](/wiki/Computus) varies from one year to the next in both the [Gregorian](/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) and [Julian](/wiki/Julian_calendar) calendars. [Eastern](/wiki/Eastern_Christianity) and [Western Christianity](/wiki/Western_Christianity) disagree over the computation of the date of [Easter](/wiki/Easter) and therefore of Good Friday. Good Friday is a widely instituted [legal holiday](/wiki/Public_holiday) around the world. Some predominantly [Christian countries](/wiki/Christian_countries), such as Germany, have laws prohibiting certain acts—public dancing, horse racing—in remembrance of the sombre nature of Good Friday. ## Etymology The term *Good Friday* comes from the sense 'pious, holy' of the word *good*. Less common examples of expressions based on this obsolete sense of *good* include 'the good book\" for the Bible, 'good tide' for Christmas or [Shrovetide](/wiki/Shrovetide), and [Good Wednesday](/wiki/Good_Wednesday) for the Wednesday in Holy Week. With regard to the usual sense of the word *good*, \"Christians believe that Jesus's death on the cross was the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins, saving mankind from death.\" A common [folk etymology](/wiki/Folk_etymology) analyses *Good Friday* incorrectly as a corruption of *God Friday*, of a type similar to the (linguistically correct) derivation of *goodbye* from a contraction of 'God be with ye'. In Old English, the day was called *Long Friday* (*langa frigedæg* [ˈlɑŋɡɑ ˈfriːjedæj])—referring to the lengthy observances of fasting and religious services, making it a day of extended devotion—and equivalents of this term are still used in Scandinavian languages and Finnish. ## Biblical accounts Part of a series onDeath and Resurrection of [Jesus](/wiki/Jesus_in_Christianity)[Passion](/wiki/Passion_of_Jesus) - **[Last Supper](/wiki/Last_Supper)** - **[Arrest](/wiki/Arrest_of_Jesus)** - **Trials** - [Sanhedrin trial](/wiki/Sanhedrin_trial_of_Jesus) - [Herod's court](/wiki/Jesus_at_Herod%27s_court) - [Pilate's court](/wiki/Pilate%27s_court) - [Flagellation](/wiki/Flagellation_of_Christ) - [Mocking](/wiki/Mocking_of_Jesus) - [Crown of thorns](/wiki/Crown_of_thorns) - *[Via Dolorosa](/wiki/Via_Dolorosa)* - **[Crucifixion and Death](/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus)** - **[Burial](/wiki/Burial_of_Jesus)** [Resurrection](/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus) - **[Empty tomb](/wiki/Empty_tomb)** - [Biblical accounts](/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus#Biblical_accounts) ([overview](/wiki/Overview_of_resurrection_appearances_in_the_Gospels_and_Paul)) - *[Noli me tangere](/wiki/Noli_me_tangere)* - [Road to Emmaus](/wiki/Road_to_Emmaus_appearance) - [Great Commission](/wiki/Great_Commission) - **[Ascension](/wiki/Ascension_of_Jesus)** [Holy Week](/wiki/Holy_Week) - [Palm Sunday](/wiki/Palm_Sunday) - [Holy Monday](/wiki/Holy_Monday) - [Holy Tuesday](/wiki/Holy_Tuesday) - [Holy Wednesday](/wiki/Holy_Wednesday) - [Maundy Thursday](/wiki/Maundy_Thursday) - Good Friday - [Holy Saturday](/wiki/Holy_Saturday) - [Easter Sunday](/wiki/Easter) Significance - [Session of Christ](/wiki/Session_of_Christ) - [Salvation](/wiki/Salvation_in_Christianity) - [Jewish eschatology](/wiki/Jewish_eschatology) - [Christian eschatology](/wiki/Christian_eschatology) Visions of Jesus - [Vision theory](/wiki/Vision_theory_of_Jesus%27_appearances) - [Visions](/wiki/Vision_(spirituality)) - [Religious experience](/wiki/Religious_experience) Empty tomb theories - [Stolen body](/wiki/Stolen_body_hypothesis) - [Swoon](/wiki/Swoon_hypothesis) - [Twin](/wiki/Substitution_hypothesis) Related - [Instrument of crucifixion](/wiki/Instrument_of_Jesus%27_crucifixion) - [Crucifixion darkness](/wiki/Crucifixion_darkness) - [Conversion of Paul the Apostle](/wiki/Conversion_of_Paul_the_Apostle) - [Islamic view](/wiki/Islamic_views_on_Jesus%27s_death) **Portals:** Christianity Bible - v - t - e According to the accounts in the Gospels, the royal soldiers, guided by Jesus' disciple [Judas Iscariot](/wiki/Judas_Iscariot), [arrested](/wiki/Arrest_of_Jesus) Jesus in the [Garden of Gethsemane](/wiki/Garden_of_Gethsemane). Judas received money ([30 pieces of silver](/wiki/30_pieces_of_silver)) for [betraying Jesus](/wiki/Bargain_of_Judas) and told the guards that whomever [he kisses](/wiki/Kiss_of_Judas) is the one they are to arrest. Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of [Annas](/wiki/Annas), the father-in-law of the [high priest](/wiki/Cohen_Gadol), [Caiaphas](/wiki/Caiaphas). There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the [Sanhedrin](/wiki/Sanhedrin) had assembled. Conflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying \"I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?\" Jesus testified ambiguously, \"You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven.\" The high priest condemned Jesus for [blasphemy](/wiki/Blasphemy), and the [Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death](/wiki/Sanhedrin_Trial_of_Jesus). Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also [denied Jesus](/wiki/Denial_of_Peter) three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had foretold. In the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor [Pontius Pilate](/wiki/Pontius_Pilate) under charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king. Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death. [Pilate questioned](/wiki/Pilate%27s_court) Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing. Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of [Galilee](/wiki/Galilee), [King Herod](/wiki/Herod_Antipas), who was in [Jerusalem](/wiki/Jerusalem) for the [Passover](/wiki/Passover) Feast. [Herod questioned](/wiki/Jesus_at_Herod%27s_court) Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found Jesus to be guilty; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released. Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked for [Barabbas](/wiki/Barabbas), who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection. Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, \"Crucify him.\" [Pilate's wife](/wiki/Pontius_Pilate%27s_wife) had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to \"have nothing to do with this righteous man.\" Pilate had Jesus [flogged](/wiki/Flagellation_of_Christ) and then brought him out to the crowd to release him. The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death \"because he claimed to be God's son.\" This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came. Coming before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he had no part in this condemnation. Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot. The sentence written was \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.\" Jesus carried his cross to the site of execution (assisted by [Simon of Cyrene](/wiki/Simon_of_Cyrene)), called the \"place of the Skull\", or \"[Golgotha](/wiki/Golgotha)\" in Hebrew and in Latin \"Calvary\". There he was crucified along with two criminals. Jesus agonized on the cross for three hours, from noon to 3 pm, [darkness fell over the whole land](/wiki/Crucifixion_darkness). In the gospels of Mathew and Mark, Jesus is said to have [spoken from the cross](/wiki/Sayings_of_Jesus_on_the_cross), quoting the messianic [Psalm 22](/wiki/Psalm_22): \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" With a loud cry, Jesus gave up his spirit. There was an earthquake, tombs broke open, and the curtain in the Temple was torn from top to bottom. The [centurion](/wiki/Centurion) on guard at the site of crucifixion declared, \"Truly this was God's Son!\" [Joseph of Arimathea](/wiki/Joseph_of_Arimathea), a member of the Sanhedrin and a secret follower of Jesus, who had not consented to his condemnation, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus. Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named [Nicodemus](/wiki/Nicodemus) brought about a hundred-pound weight mixture of spices and helped wrap the body of Jesus. Pilate asked confirmation from the centurion of whether Jesus was dead. A soldier pierced the side of Jesus with a lance causing blood and water to flow out, and the centurion informed Pilate that Jesus was dead. Joseph of Arimathea took Jesus' body, wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock in a garden near the site of the crucifixion. Nicodemus also brought 75 pounds of [myrrh](/wiki/Myrrh) and [aloes](/wiki/Aloes), and placed them in the linen with the body, in keeping with Jewish burial customs. They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb. Then they returned home and rested, because [Shabbat](/wiki/Shabbat) had begun at sunset. ## Eastern Orthodox Byzantine Christians ([Eastern Christians](/wiki/Eastern_Christians) who follow the [Rite of Constantinople](/wiki/Rite_of_Constantinople): [Orthodox Christians](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church) and [Greek-Catholics](/wiki/Greek_Catholic_Church)) call this day \"Great and Holy Friday\", or simply \"Great Friday\". Because the sacrifice of Jesus through his crucifixion is recalled on this day, the [Divine Liturgy](/wiki/Divine_Liturgy) (the sacrifice of bread and wine) is never celebrated on Great Friday, except when this day coincides with the [Great Feast](/wiki/Great_Feast) of the [Annunciation](/wiki/Annunciation), which falls on the fixed date of 25 March (for those churches which follow the traditional [Julian Calendar](/wiki/Julian_Calendar), 25 March currently falls on 7 April of the modern [Gregorian Calendar](/wiki/Gregorian_Calendar)). Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout [Great Lent](/wiki/Great_Lent), but instead don [black vestments](/wiki/Black_vestments). There is no \"stripping of the altar\" on [Holy and Great Thursday](/wiki/Maundy_Thursday) as in the West; instead, all of the [church hangings](/wiki/Antipendia) are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on [Great Saturday](/wiki/Great_Saturday). The faithful revisit the events of the day through the public reading of specific [Psalms](/wiki/Psalms) and the [Gospels](/wiki/Gospel), and singing [hymns](/wiki/Hymn) about Christ's death. Rich visual imagery and symbolism, as well as stirring hymnody, are remarkable elements of these observances. In the [Orthodox](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church) understanding, the events of [Holy Week](/wiki/Holy_Week) are not simply an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participate in the death and the [resurrection of Jesus](/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus). Great and Holy Friday is observed as an absolute [fast](/wiki/Fasting), and adult Byzantine Christians are expected to abstain from all food and drink the entire day to the extent that their health permits. \"On this Holy day neither a meal is offered nor do we eat on this day of the crucifixion. If someone is unable or has become very old [or is] unable to fast, he may be given bread and water after sunset. In this way we come to the holy commandment of the Holy Apostles not to eat on Great Friday.\" (cf. *[Black Fast](/wiki/Black_Fast)*) ### Matins of Holy and Great Friday The Byzantine Christian observance of Holy and Great Friday, which is formally known as **The Order of Holy and Saving Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ**, begins on Thursday night with the **Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels**. Scattered throughout this [Matins](/wiki/Matins) service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the [Passion](/wiki/Passion_(Christianity)) from the [Last Supper](/wiki/Last_Supper) through the [Crucifixion](/wiki/Crucifixion) and [burial](/wiki/Holy_Sepulchre) of Jesus. Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished. The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the [liturgical year](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_liturgical_calendar), and is a [concatenation](/wiki/Concatenation) from all [four Gospels](/wiki/Four_Gospels). Just before the sixth Gospel reading, which recounts Jesus being nailed to the cross, a large [cross](/wiki/Christian_cross) is carried out of the sanctuary by the priest, accompanied by [incense](/wiki/Incense) and candles, and is placed in the center of the [nave](/wiki/Nave) (where the congregation gathers) *Sēmeron Kremātai Epí Xýlou*: > Today He who hung the earth upon the waters is hung upon the Cross *(three times)*. > He who is King of the angels is arrayed in a crown of thorns. > He who wraps the Heavens in clouds is wrapped in the purple of mockery. > He who in Jordan set Adam free receives blows upon His face. > The Bridegroom of the Church is transfixed with nails. > The Son of the Virgin is pierced with a spear. > We venerate Thy Passion, O Christ *(three times)*. > Show us also Thy glorious Resurrection. The readings are: 1. John 13:31-18:1 – Christ's last sermon, Jesus prays for the [apostles](/wiki/Apostles_in_the_New_Testament) 2. John 18:1–28 – The agony in the [garden](/wiki/Garden_of_Gethsemane), the mockery and denial of Christ 3. Matthew 26:57–75 – The mockery of Christ, [Peter](/wiki/Saint_Peter) denies Christ 4. John 18:28–19:16 – [Pilate](/wiki/Pontius_Pilate) questions Jesus; Jesus is condemned; Jesus is mocked by the Romans. 5. Matthew 27:3–32 – [Judas](/wiki/Judas) commits suicide; Jesus is condemned; Jesus mocked by the Romans; [Simon of Cyrene](/wiki/Simon_of_Cyrene) compelled to carry the cross 6. Mark 15:16–32 – Jesus dies 7. Matthew 27:33–54 – Jesus dies 8. Luke 23:32–49 – Jesus dies 9. John 19:25–37 – Jesus dies 10. Mark 15:43–47 – [Joseph of Arimathea](/wiki/Joseph_of_Arimathea) buries Jesus 11. John 19:38–42 – Joseph of Arimathea buries Jesus 12. Matthew 27:62–66 – The Jews set a guard During the service, all come forward to kiss the feet of Christ on the cross. After the [Canon](/wiki/Canon_(hymnography)), a brief, moving hymn, *The Wise Thief* is chanted by singers who stand at the foot of the cross in the center of the nave. The service does not end with the [First Hour](/wiki/First_Hour), as usual, but with a special [dismissal](/wiki/Dismissal_(liturgy)) by the priest: > May Christ our true God, Who for the salvation of the world endured spitting, and scourging, and buffeting, and the Cross, and death, through the intercessions of His [most pure Mother](/wiki/Theotokos), of our holy and [God-bearing fathers](/wiki/Holy_Fathers), and of all the [saints](/wiki/Saint), have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and the Lover of mankind. ### Royal Hours The next day, in the forenoon on Friday, all gather again to pray the ***Royal Hours***, a special expanded celebration of the [Little Hours](/wiki/Little_Hours) (including the First Hour, [Third Hour](/wiki/Third_Hour), [Sixth Hour](/wiki/Sext), [Ninth Hour](/wiki/Ninth_Hour) and [Typica](/wiki/Typica)) with the addition of scripture readings ([Old Testament](/wiki/Old_Testament), [Epistle](/wiki/Epistle) and Gospel) and hymns about the Crucifixion at each of the Hours (some of the material from the previous night is repeated). This is somewhat more festive in character, and derives its name of \"Royal\" from both the fact that the Hours are served with more solemnity than normal, commemorating Christ the King who humbled himself for the salvation of mankind, and also from the fact that this service was in the past attended by the Emperor and his court. ### Vespers of Holy and Great Friday In the afternoon, around 3 pm, all gather for the Vespers of the Taking-Down from the Cross, commemorating the [Deposition from the Cross](/wiki/Deposition_from_the_Cross). Following Psalm 103 (104) and the Great Litany, 'Lord, I call' is sung without a Psalter reading. The first five stichera (the first being repeated) are taken from the Aposticha at Matins the night before, but the final 3 of the 5 are sung in Tone 2. Three more stichera in Tone 6 lead to the Entrance. The Evening Prokimenon is taken from Psalm 21 (22): 'They parted My garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture.' There are then four readings, with Prokimena before the second and fourth: - Exodus 33:11-23 - God shows Moses His glory - The second Prokimenon is from Psalm 34 (35): 'Judge them, O Lord, that wrong Me: fight against them that fight against Me.' - Job 42:12-20 - God restores Job's wealth (note that verses 18-20 are found only in the Septuagint) - Isaiah 52:13-54:1 - The fourth [Suffering Servant song](/wiki/Servant_songs) - The third Prokimenon is from Psalm 87 (88): 'They laid me in the lowest pit: in dark places and in the shadow of death.' - 1 Corinthians 1:18-2:2 - St. Paul places Christ crucified as the centre of the Christian life An Alleluia is then sung, with verses from Psalm 68 (69): 'Save Me, O God: for the waters are come in, even unto my soul.' The Gospel reading is a composite taken from three of the four the Gospels (Matthew 27:1-38; Luke 23:39-43; Matthew 27:39-54; John 19:31-37; Matthew 27:55-61), essentially the story of the crucifixion as it appears according to St. Matthew, interspersed with St. Luke's account of the confession of the Good Thief and St. John's account of blood and water flowing from Jesus' side. During the Gospel, the body of Christ (the *soma*) is removed from the cross, and, as the words in the Gospel reading mention Joseph of Arimathea, is wrapped in a linen shroud, and taken to the [altar](/wiki/Altar) in the sanctuary. The Aposticha reflects on the burial of Christ. Either at this point (in the Greek use) or during the troparion following (in the Slav use): > Noble Joseph, taking down Thy most pure body from the Tree, wrapped it in pure linen and spices, and he laid it in a new tomb. An *[epitaphios](/wiki/Epitaphios_(liturgical))* or \"winding sheet\" (a cloth embroidered with the image of Christ prepared for burial) is carried in procession to a low table in the nave which represents the Tomb of Christ; it is often decorated with an abundance of flowers. The epitaphios itself represents the body of Jesus wrapped in a burial shroud, and is a roughly full-size cloth icon of the body of Christ. The service ends with a hope of the Resurrection: > The Angel stood by the tomb, and to the women bearing spices he cried aloud: 'Myrrh is fitting for the dead, but Christ has shown Himself a stranger to corruption. Then the priest may deliver a [homily](/wiki/Homily) and everyone comes forward to venerate the epitaphios. In the [Slavic](/wiki/Slavic_peoples) practice, at the end of Vespers, [Compline](/wiki/Compline) is immediately served, featuring a special *Canon of the Crucifixion of our Lord and the Lamentation of the Most Holy Theotokos* by Symeon the Logothete. ### Matins of Holy and Great Saturday On Friday night, the Matins of [Holy and Great Saturday](/wiki/Holy_and_Great_Saturday), a unique service known as *The Lamentation at the Tomb* *(Epitáphios Thrēnos)* is celebrated. This service is also sometimes called *Jerusalem Matins*. Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave. In Greek communities all over the world, the Epitaphios procession is a ceremonial funeral procession for Christ that takes place in Greek Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic traditions on Good Friday, where a decorated kouvouklion is carried around local cities. The decorated kouvouklion symbolizes the casket or tomb of Jesus Christ, and when it is fully decorated with flowers, candles, and the special iconographic cloth depicting the dead body of Christ known as the epitaphios cloth, the entire object is referred to as the Epitaphios. A unique feature of the service is the chanting of the Lamentations or Praises (*[Enkōmia](/wiki/Encomium)*), which consist of verses chanted by the clergy 9 interspersed between the verses of [Psalm 118](/wiki/Psalm_119) (which is, by far, the longest [psalm](/wiki/Psalm) in the Bible). The *Enkōmia* are the best-loved hymns of Greek Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day. They consist of 185 [tercet](/wiki/Tercet) [antiphons](/wiki/Antiphon) arranged in three parts (*stáseis* or \"stops\"), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 118, and nine short *doxastiká* (\"[Gloriae](/wiki/Gloria_in_excelsis_Deo)\") and *Theotókia* (invocations to the Virgin Mary). The three *stáseis* are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: Ἡ ζωὴ ἐν τάφῳ, \"Life in a grave\", Ἄξιον ἐστί, \"Worthy it is\", and Αἱ γενεαὶ πᾶσαι, \"All the generations\". Musically they can be classified as [strophic](/wiki/Strophic), with 75, 62, and 48 tercet [stanzas](/wiki/Stanza) each, respectively. The climax of the *Enkōmia* comes during the third *stásis*, with the antiphon \"Ω γλυκύ μου ἔαρ\", a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child (\"O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where has your beauty gone?\"). Later, during a different antiphon of that stasis (\"Early in the morning the myrrh-bearers came to Thee and sprinkled myrrh upon Thy tomb\"), young girls of the parish place flowers on the Epitaphios and the priest sprinkles it with rose-water. The author(s) and date of the *Enkōmia* are unknown. Their High Attic linguistic style suggests a dating around the 6th century, possibly before the time of [St. Romanos the Melodist](/wiki/St._Romanos_the_Melodist). The Evlogitaria (Benedictions) of the Resurrection are sung as on Sunday, since they refer to the conversation between the myrrh-bearers and the angel in the tomb, followed by kathismata about the burial of Christ. Psalm 50 (51) is then immediately read, and then followed by a much loved-canon, written by Mark the Monk, Bishop of Hydrous and Kosmas of the Holy City, with irmoi by Kassiani the Nun. The high-point of the much-loved Canon is Ode 9, which takes the form of a dialogue between Christ and the Theotokos, with Christ promising His Mother the hope of the Resurrection. This Canon will be sung again the following night at the Midnight Office. Lauds follows, and its stichera take the form of a funeral lament, while always preserving the hope of the Resurrection. The doxasticon links Christ's rest in the tomb with His rest on the seventh day of creation, and the theotokion (\"Most blessed art thou, O Virgin Theotokos...) is the same as is used on Sundays.[*citation needed*] At the end of the [Great Doxology](/wiki/Great_Doxology), while the [Trisagion](/wiki/Trisagion) is sung, the epitaphios is taken in [procession](/wiki/Crucession) around the outside of the church, and is then returned to the tomb. Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful must bow down under it as they come back into the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ. The epitaphios will lie in the tomb until the Paschal Service early Sunday morning. In some churches, the epitaphios is never left alone, but is accompanied 24 hours a day by a reader chanting from the Psalter.[*citation needed*] When the procession has returned to the church, a troparion is read, similar to the ones read at the Sixth Hour throughout Lent, focusing on the purpose of Christ's burial. A series of prokimena and readings are then said: - The first prokimenon is from Psalm 43 (44): 'Arise, Lord, and help us: and deliver us for Thy Name's sake.' - Ezekiel 37:1-14 - God tells Ezekiel to command bones to come to life. - The second prokimenon is from Psalm 9 (9–10), and is based on the verses sung at the kathismata and Lauds on Sundays: 'Arise, O Lord my God, lift up Thine hand: forget not Thy poor forever.' - 1 Corinthians 5:6-8; Galatians 3:13-14 - St. Paul celebrates the Passion of Christ and explains its role in the life of Gentile Christians. - The Alleluia verses are from Psalm 67 (68), and are based on the Paschal verses: 'Let God arise, and let His enemies be scattered.' - Matthew 27:62-66 - The Pharisees ask Pilate to set a watch at the tomb. At the end of the service, a final hymn is sung as the faithful come to venerate the Epitaphios.[*citation needed*] ## Roman Catholic In Latin, the name used by the Catholic Church until 1955 was *Feria sexta in Parasceve* (\"Friday of Preparation [for the Sabbath]\"). In the 1955 reform of Holy Week, it was renamed *Feria sexta in Passione et Morte Domini* (\"Friday of the Passion and Death of the Lord\"), and in the new rite introduced in 1970, shortened to *Feria sexta in Passione Domini* (\"Friday of the Passion of the Lord\"). ### Day of Fasting The Catholic Church regards Good Friday and [Holy Saturday](/wiki/Holy_Saturday) as the Paschal fast, in accordance with Article 110 of [Sacrosanctum Concilium](/wiki/Sacrosanctum_Concilium). In the [Latin Church](/wiki/Latin_Church), a [fast day](/wiki/Fasting_and_abstinence_in_the_Catholic_Church) is understood as having only one full meal and two [collations](/wiki/Collation_(meal)) (a smaller repast, the two of which together do not equal the one full meal) – although this may be observed less stringently on Holy Saturday than on Good Friday. ### Services on the day The [Roman Rite](/wiki/Roman_Rite) has no celebration of [Mass](/wiki/Mass_in_the_Catholic_Church) between the [Mass of the Lord's Supper](/wiki/Mass_of_the_Lord%27s_Supper) on Holy Thursday (Maundy Thursday) evening and the [Easter Vigil](/wiki/Easter_Vigil) unless a special exemption is granted for rare solemn or grave occasions by the [Vatican](/wiki/Holy_See) or the [local bishop](/wiki/Ordinary_(officer)). The only [sacraments](/wiki/Sacrament) celebrated during this time are [Baptism](/wiki/Baptism) (for those in danger of death), [Penance](/wiki/Sacrament_of_Penance_(Catholic_Church)), and [Anointing of the Sick](/wiki/Anointing_of_the_Sick). While there is no celebration of the Eucharist, it is distributed to the faithful only in the **Celebration of the Passion of the Lord**, but can also be taken at any hour to the sick who are unable to attend this celebration. The [Collection for the Holy Places](/wiki/Collection_for_the_Holy_Places) is taken up on Good Friday. The Celebration of the Passion of the Lord takes place in the afternoon, ideally at three o'clock; however, for pastoral reasons (especially in countries where Good Friday is not a public holiday), it is permissible to celebrate the liturgy earlier, even shortly after midday, or at a later hour. The celebration consists of three parts: the liturgy of the word, the adoration of the cross, and the Holy communion. The altar is bare, without cross, candlesticks and [altar cloths](/wiki/Altar_cloth). It is also customary to empty the [holy water](/wiki/Holy_water) [fonts](/wiki/Holy_water_font) in preparation of the blessing of the water at the Easter Vigil. Traditionally, no bells are rung on Good Friday or Holy Saturday until the Easter Vigil. The [liturgical colour](/wiki/Liturgical_colour) of the vestments used is red. Before 1970, vestments were black except for the Communion part of the rite when violet was used. If a bishop or [abbot](/wiki/Abbot) celebrates, he wears a plain [mitre](/wiki/Mitre) *(mitra simplex)*. Before the reforms of the Holy Week liturgies in 1955, black was used throughout. Aside from the celebration of the Solemn Liturgy of the Passion the usual offices of the Liturgy of the Hours are said by all those canonically required and celebrated publicly in religious communities. The liturgy consists of the normal major hours of [Matins](/wiki/Matins) and [Laudes](/wiki/Lauds) (these first two morning services are often combined to form the office of Good Friday [Tenebrae](/wiki/Tenebrae)), the [minor hours](/wiki/Little_Hours) of [Terce](/wiki/Terce), [Sext](/wiki/Sext) and [None](/wiki/None_(liturgy)). It excludes the evening major and minor hours, [Vespers](/wiki/Vespers) and [Compline](/wiki/Compline) respectively, which are only prayed by those who are unable to attend a celebration of the Liturgy of the Passion, giving the days pattern of worship an abrupt conclusion representing Jesus's death. ### Three Hours' Agony The [Three Hours' Devotion](/wiki/Three_Hours%27_Agony) based on the [Seven Last Words from the Cross](/wiki/Seven_Last_Words_from_the_Cross) begins at noon and ends at 3 pm, the time that the Christian tradition teaches that Jesus died on the cross. ### Liturgy The Good Friday liturgy consists of three parts: the [Liturgy of the Word](/wiki/Liturgy_of_the_Word), the Veneration of the Cross, and the [Holy Communion](/wiki/Holy_Communion). - The Liturgy of the Word consists of the clergy and assisting ministers entering in complete silence, without any singing. They then silently make a full [prostration](/wiki/Prostration). This signifies the abasement ([the fall](/wiki/Fall_of_man)) of (earthly) humans. It also symbolizes the grief and sorrow of the Church. Then follows the [Collect](/wiki/Collect) prayer, and the reading or chanting of Isaiah 52:13–53:12, Hebrews 4:14–16, Hebrews 5:7–9, and the [Passion](/wiki/Passion_(Christianity)) account from the [Gospel of John](/wiki/Gospel_of_John), traditionally divided between three deacons, yet usually read by the celebrant and two other readers. In the older form of the Mass known as the [Tridentine Mass](/wiki/Tridentine_Mass) the readings for Good Friday are taken from Exodus 12:1-11 and the Gospel according to St. John (John 18:1-40); (John 19:1-42). - The Great Intercessions also known as *orationes sollemnes* immediately follows the Liturgy of the Word and consists of a series of prayers for the Church, the Pope, the clergy and laity of the Church, those preparing for baptism, the unity of Christians, the Jews, those who do not believe in Christ, those who do not believe in God, those in public office, and those in special need. After each prayer intention, the deacon calls the faithful to kneel for a short period of private prayer; the celebrant then sums up the prayer intention with a Collect-style prayer. As part of the pre-1955 Holy Week Liturgy, the kneeling was omitted only for the [prayer for the Jews](/wiki/Good_Friday_prayer_for_the_Jews). - The Adoration of the Cross has a [crucifix](/wiki/Crucifix), not necessarily the one that is normally on or near the altar at other times of the year, solemnly unveiled and displayed to the congregation, and then venerated by them, individually if possible and usually by kissing the wood of the cross, while hymns and the [Improperia](/wiki/Improperia) (\"Reproaches\") with the [Trisagion](/wiki/Trisagion) hymn are chanted. - Holy Communion is bestowed according to a rite based on that of the final part of Mass, beginning with the [Lord's Prayer](/wiki/Lord%27s_Prayer), but omitting the ceremony of \"[Breaking of the Bread](/wiki/Fraction_(religion))\" and its related acclamation, the [Agnus Dei](/wiki/Agnus_Dei_(liturgy)). The [Eucharist](/wiki/Eucharist), consecrated at the evening [Mass of the Lord's Supper](/wiki/Mass_of_the_Lord%27s_Supper) on [Maundy Thursday](/wiki/Maundy_Thursday), is distributed at this service. Before the Holy Week reforms of [Pope Pius XII](/wiki/Pope_Pius_XII) in 1955, only the priest received Communion in the framework of what was called the [Mass of the Presanctified](/wiki/Mass_of_the_Presanctified), which included the usual Offertory prayers, with the placing of wine in the chalice, but which omitted the [Canon of the Mass](/wiki/Canon_of_the_Mass). The priest and people then depart in silence, and the altar cloth is removed, leaving the altar bare except for the crucifix and two or four candlesticks. ### Stations of the Cross In addition to the prescribed [liturgical](/wiki/Christian_liturgy) service, the [Stations of the Cross](/wiki/Stations_of_the_Cross) are often prayed either in the church or outside, and a prayer service may be held from midday to 3.00 pm, known as the Three Hours' Agony. In countries such as Malta, Italy, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Spain, processions with statues representing the Passion of Christ are held. In Rome, since the papacy of [John Paul II](/wiki/John_Paul_II), the heights of the [Temple of Venus and Roma](/wiki/Temple_of_Venus_and_Roma) and their position opposite the main entrance to the Colosseum have been used to good effect as a public address platform. This may be seen in the photograph below where a red canopy has been erected to shelter the Pope as well as an illuminated cross, on the occasion of the **Way of the Cross** ceremony. The Pope, either personally or through a representative, leads the faithful through meditations on the stations of the cross while a cross is carried from there to the Colosseum. ### Plenary indulgence In the Roman Catholic Church, plenary [indulgence](/wiki/Indulgence) is obtained if the faithful venerates the cross with [piety](/wiki/Piety) in the solemn Celebration of the Passion of the Lord on Good Friday. ### Novena to the Divine Mercy The [novena](/wiki/Novena) to the [Divine Mercy](/wiki/Divine_Mercy_(Catholic_devotion)) begins on that day and lasts until the Saturday before [Divine Mercy Sunday](/wiki/Divine_Mercy_Sunday). Both days are linked in terms of content, as the mercy of God flows from the [Sacred Heart of Jesus](/wiki/Sacred_Heart) that was pierced on the cross. ### *Collecta Pro Terra Sancta* [Paul VI](/wiki/Paul_VI) established the *Collecta Pro Terra Sancta* to be held on Good Friday, a fundraising that was confirmed by all subsequent popes. ## Protestant ### Lutheran Church In [Lutheran](/wiki/Lutheranism) tradition from the 16th to the 20th century, Good Friday was the most important religious holiday, and abstention from all worldly works was expected. During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the Eucharist on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the *[St Matthew Passion](/wiki/St_Matthew_Passion)* by [Johann Sebastian Bach](/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach). More recently, Lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured Good Friday as part of the larger sweep of the great Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter. The three days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus. As part of the liturgy of the three days, Lutherans generally fast from the Eucharist on Good Friday. Rather, it is celebrated in remembrance of the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday and at the [Vigil of Easter](/wiki/Vigil_of_Easter). One practice among Lutheran churches is to celebrate a [tenebrae](/wiki/Tenebrae#Lutheran_practice) service on Good Friday, typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels. While being called \"Tenebrae\" it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed Catholic monastic rite of the same name. The Good Friday liturgy appointed in *[Evangelical Lutheran Worship](/wiki/Evangelical_Lutheran_Worship)*, the worship book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, specifies a liturgy similar to the revised Roman Catholic liturgy. A rite for adoration of the crucified Christ includes the optional singing of the [Solemn Reproaches](/wiki/Improperia#Lutheranism) in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the [anti-Jewish overtones](/wiki/Jewish_deicide) in previous versions. Many Lutheran churches have Good Friday services, such as the [Three Hours' Agony](/wiki/Three_Hours%27_Agony) centered on the remembrance of the \"Seven Last Words,\" sayings of Jesus assembled from the four gospels, while others hold a liturgy that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross, and a singular biblical account of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John. Along with observing a general Lenten fast, many Lutherans emphasize the importance of Good Friday as a day of fasting within the calendar. *A Handbook for the Discipline of Lent* recommends the Lutheran guideline to \"Fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday with only one simple meal during the day, usually without meat\". ### Anglican Communion In the Anglican Communion, the [Black Fast](/wiki/Black_Fast) has been historically observed by devout believers. The Black Fast was especially popular during the 19th century as it sought to imitate \"the fasting of the ancient church.\" The [1662 *Book of Common Prayer*](/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer_(1662)) did not specify a particular rite to be observed on Good Friday but local custom came to mandate an assortment of services, including the Seven Last Words from the Cross and a three-hour service consisting of Matins, Ante-communion (using the [Reserved Sacrament](/wiki/Reserved_Sacrament) in [high church](/wiki/High_church) parishes) and [Evensong](/wiki/Evening_Prayer_(Book_of_Common_Prayer)). In recent times,[*when?*] revised editions of the Prayer Book and [Common Worship](/wiki/Common_Worship) have re-introduced pre-[Reformation](/wiki/Protestant_Reformation) forms of observance of Good Friday corresponding to those in today's Roman Catholic Church, with special nods to the rites that had been observed in the Church of England prior to the [Henrican, Edwardian and Elizabethan reforms](/wiki/English_Reformation), including Creeping to the Cross. ### Methodist Church Many [Methodist denominations](/wiki/Methodism) commemorate Good Friday with fasting, as well as a [service of worship](/wiki/Church_service) based on the Seven Last Words from the Cross; this liturgy is known as the [Three Hours Devotion](/wiki/Three_Hours%27_Agony) as it starts at noon and concludes at 3 pm, the latter being the time that Jesus died on the cross. On Maundy Thursday, the altar and the cross [are usually veiled](/wiki/Stripping_of_the_Altar) in black for Good Friday, as black is the liturgical colour for Good Friday in the United Methodist Church. A wooden cross may sit in front of the bare chancel. ### Moravian Church [Moravians](/wiki/Moravian_Church) hold a [Lovefeast](/wiki/Lovefeast) on Good Friday as they receive Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday. Communicants of the Moravian Church practice the Good Friday tradition of cleaning [gravestones in Moravian cemeteries](/wiki/God%27s_Acre). ### Reformed Churches In the [Reformed](/wiki/Reformed_tradition) tradition, Good Friday is one of the [evangelical feasts](/wiki/Evangelical_feast) and is thus widely observed with [church services](/wiki/Church_service), which feature the Solemn Reproaches in the pattern of [Psalm 78](/wiki/Psalm_78), towards the end of the liturgy. ### Other Christian traditions Many [Protestant](/wiki/Protestant) churches hold an [Interdenominational](/wiki/Interdenominational) [service](/wiki/Church_service) with [Lord's Supper](/wiki/Lord%27s_Supper). ## Associated customs In many countries and territories with a strong Christian tradition such as Australia, Argentina, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, the countries of the Caribbean, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Malta, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines, Portugal, the Scandinavian countries, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela, the day is observed as a [public or federal holiday](/wiki/List_of_holidays_by_country). In the United States, 12 states observe Good Friday as state holiday: Connecticut, Texas, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Tennessee, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina and North Dakota. One associated custom is strict adherence to the [Black Fast](/wiki/Black_Fast), where believers fast from food and liquids during the day and after sunset, a [vegetarian](/wiki/Christian_vegetarianism) meal with water is consumed. St. [Ambrose](/wiki/Ambrose), St. [Chrysostom](/wiki/John_Chrysostom) and St. [Basil](/wiki/Basil_of_Caesarea) attest to the practice. The processions of the day, hymns \"[Crux fidelis](/wiki/Crux_fidelis)\" by [King John of Portugal](/wiki/John_I_of_Portugal), and [Eberlin's](/wiki/Johann_Ernst_Eberlin) \"[Tenebrae factae sunt](/wiki/Tenebrae_factae_sunt)\", followed by \"[Vexilla Regis](/wiki/Vexilla_regis_prodeunt)\" is sung, translated from Latin as *the standards of the King advance*, and then follows a ceremony that is not a real Mass, it is called the \"[Mass of the Pre-Sanctified](/wiki/Mass_of_the_Presanctified).\". This custom is respected also by forgoing the Mass, this is to take heed to the solemnity of the Sacrifice of Calvary. This is where the host of the prior day is placed at the altar, incensed, elevated so \"that it may be seen by the people\" and consumed. Germany and some other countries have laws prohibiting certain acts, such as dancing and horse racing, that are seen as profaning the solemn nature of the day. ### Australia Good Friday is a holiday under state and territory laws in all states and territories in Australia. Generally speaking, shops in all Australian states (but not in the two territories of the [Northern Territory](/wiki/Northern_Territory) and the [Australian Capital Territory](/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory)) are required to remain closed for the duration of Good Friday, although there are certain shops which are permitted to open and other shops can apply for exemptions. All schools and universities close on Good Friday in Australia, and Good Friday falls within the school holidays in most years in all states and territories except the Northern Territory, although many states now commence their school holidays in early April regardless of Easter. In 2024, for example, when Good Friday fell on 29 March, only [Queensland](/wiki/Queensland), [Victoria](/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)) and [Western Australia](/wiki/Western_Australia) had school holidays which coincided with Good Friday. The vast majority of businesses are closed on Good Friday, although many recreational businesses, such as the [Sydney Royal Easter Show](/wiki/Sydney_Royal_Easter_Show), open on Good Friday as among non-religious families Good Friday is a popular day to indulge in such activities. ### Canada In Canada, Good Friday is a [federal statutory holiday](/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Canada). In the province of Quebec \"employers can choose to give the day off either on Good Friday or Easter Monday.\" ### Cuba In an online article posted on [Catholic News Agency](/wiki/Catholic_News_Agency) by Alejandro Bermúdez on 31 March 2012, [Cuban President](/wiki/President_of_Cuba) [Raúl Castro](/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Castro), with the [Communist Party](/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Cuba) and his advisers, decreed that Good Friday that year would be a holiday. This was Castro's response to a request made personally to him by [Pope Benedict XVI](/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI) during the latter's Apostolic Visitation to the island and [León](/wiki/Leon,_Mexico), [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico) that month. The move followed the pattern of small advances in Cuba's relations with the Vatican, mirroring Pope John Paul II's success in getting [Fidel Castro](/wiki/Fidel_Castro) to declare [Christmas Day](/wiki/Christmas_Day) a holiday. Both Good Friday and Christmas are now [annual holidays in Cuba](/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Cuba). ### Germany In Germany Good Friday is known as *Karfreitag* (*kara* means \"sorrow\" in [Old High German](/wiki/Old_High_German)); it is a *Stiller Feiertag* (silent holiday), and there are strict rules banning activities deemed disrespectful to Christians. Rules vary among the sixteen different federal states, but often prohibit dancing and the use of loud appliances such as lawnmowers and leaf blowers. Nightclubs are shut, and films that may be shown in cinemas are restricted. In recent times the holiday has been informally called *Carfreitag* by extreme car enthusiasts, including those from other countries who visit Germany, who [tune cars](/wiki/Car_tuning) illegally and hold [illegal races](/wiki/Street_racing) on public roads. Police seek to prevent unauthorised tuning, illegal races, noise, and pollution. Offenders can be fined and have points put on their licences, and in some cases lose their licences and have their cars confiscated. ### Hong Kong In [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong), Good Friday was designated a public holiday in the Holidays Ordinance, 1875. Good Friday continues to be a holiday after the [transfer of sovereignty from the UK to China](/wiki/Handover_of_Hong_Kong) in 1997. Government offices, banks, post offices and most offices are closed on Good Friday. ### Ireland In the [Republic of Ireland](/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland), Good Friday is not an official public holiday, but most non-retail businesses close for the day. Up until 2018 it was illegal to sell alcoholic beverages on Good Friday, with some exceptions, so pubs and off-licences generally closed. Critics of the ban included the catering and tourism sector, but surveys showed that the general public were divided on the issue. In [Northern Ireland](/wiki/Northern_Ireland), a similar ban operates until 5 pm on Good Friday. ### Malaysia Although Malaysia is a [Muslim majority country](/wiki/Muslim_world), Good Friday is declared as a public holiday in the states of [Sabah](/wiki/Sabah) and [Sarawak](/wiki/Sarawak) in [East Malaysia](/wiki/East_Malaysia) as there is a significant Christian indigenous population in both states. ### Malta The Holy Week commemorations reach their peak on Good Friday as the Roman Catholic Church celebrates the [Passion of Jesus](/wiki/Passion_of_Jesus). Solemn celebrations take place in all churches together with processions in different villages around [Malta](/wiki/Malta) and [Gozo](/wiki/Gozo). During the celebration, the narrative of the passion is read in some localities, while the Adoration of the Cross follows. Good Friday processions take place in [Birgu](/wiki/Birgu), [Bormla](/wiki/Bormla), [Għaxaq](/wiki/G%C4%A7axaq), [Luqa](/wiki/Luqa), [Mosta](/wiki/Mosta), [Naxxar](/wiki/Naxxar), [Paola](/wiki/Paola,_Malta), [Qormi](/wiki/Qormi), [Rabat](/wiki/Rabat,_Malta), [Senglea](/wiki/Senglea), [Valletta](/wiki/Valletta), [Żebbuġ (Città Rohan)](/wiki/%C5%BBebbu%C4%A1,_Malta) and [Żejtun](/wiki/%C5%BBejtun). Processions in Gozo occur in [Nadur](/wiki/Nadur), [Victoria](/wiki/Victoria,_Gozo) (St. George and Cathedral), [Xagħra](/wiki/Xag%C4%A7ra) and [Żebbuġ, Gozo](/wiki/%C5%BBebbu%C4%A1,_Gozo).[*citation needed*] ### New Zealand In New Zealand, Good Friday is a legal holiday and is a day of mandatory school closure for all New Zealand state and integrated schools. Good Friday is also a restricted trading day in New Zealand, which means that unexempted shops are not permitted to open on this day. ### Philippines In the predominantly [Roman Catholic](/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_the_Philippines) [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines), the day is commemorated with street processions, the [Way of the Cross](/wiki/Way_of_the_Cross), the chanting of the *[Pasyón](/wiki/Pasyon)*, *[Siete Palabras](/wiki/Sayings_of_Jesus_on_the_cross)* or the Seven Last Words of Jesus on the Cross, and performances of the *Senákulo* or [Passion play](/wiki/Passion_play). Some devotees engage in self-[flagellation](/wiki/Flagellant) and even have themselves [crucified](/wiki/Crucifixion_in_the_Philippines) as expressions of penance despite health risks and strong disapproval from the Church. Church bells are not rung and Masses are not celebrated, while television features movies, documentaries and other shows focused on the religious event and other topics related to the Catholic faith, broadcasting mostly religious content. Malls and shops are generally closed, as are restaurants as it is the second of three public holidays within the week.[*citation needed*] After three o'clock in the afternoon (the time at which Jesus is traditionally believed to have died), the faithful venerate the cross in the local church and follow the procession of the Burial of Jesus.[*citation needed*] In [Cebu](/wiki/Cebu) and many parts of the [Visayan Islands](/wiki/Visayan_Islands), people usually eat *[binignit](/wiki/Binignit)* and *[biko](/wiki/Cuisine_of_the_Philippines#Merienda)* as a form of fasting. ### Poland In Polish churches, a tableau of Christ's Tomb is unveiled in the sanctuary. Many of the faithful spend long hours into the night grieving at the Tomb, where it is customary to kiss the wounds on the Lord's body. A life-size figure of Jesus lying in his tomb is widely visited by the faithful, especially on Holy Saturday. The tableaux may include flowers, candles, figures of angels standing watch, and the three crosses atop Mt Calvary, and much more. Each parish strives to come up with the most artistically and religiously evocative arrangement in which the Blessed Sacrament, draped in a filmy veil, is prominently displayed.[*citation needed*] ### Singapore Good Friday is a public holiday in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). ### Spain ### United Kingdom In the UK Good Friday was historically a common law holiday; it is today recognised as an official public holiday ([bank holiday](/wiki/Bank_holiday)). All state schools are closed and most businesses treat it as a holiday for staff; however, many retail stores remain open. [Government](/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Civil_Service) services in Northern Ireland operate as normal on Good Friday, closing instead on [Easter Tuesday](/wiki/Easter_Tuesday). There has traditionally been no horse racing on Good Friday in the UK. However, in 2008, betting shops and stores opened for the first time on this day, and in 2014 Lingfield Park and Musselburgh staged the UK's first Good Friday race meetings. The [BBC Radio 4](/wiki/BBC_Radio_4) 7 am News broadcast on Good Friday is traditionally introduced with a verse from [Isaac Watts](/wiki/Isaac_Watts)' hymn \"[When I Survey the Wondrous Cross](/wiki/When_I_Survey_the_Wondrous_Cross)\". The tradition of Easter plays includes 1960 Eastertime performance of Good Friday: A Play in Verse (1916) Artists [Ursula O'Leary](/wiki/Ursula_O%27Leary) ([Procula](/wiki/Procula)), and [William Devlin](/wiki/William_Devlin_(actor)) as [Pontius Pilate](/wiki/Pontius_Pilate), perform with the atmospheric sound effects of the [BBC Radiophonic Workshop](/wiki/BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop). The Hugh Stewart production for the [Home Service](/wiki/Home_Service) used soundware such as the [EMS Synthi 100](/wiki/EMS_Synthi_100) and [ARP Odyssey l](/wiki/ARP_Odyssey_l). ### United States In the United States, Good Friday is not a federal government holiday. The postal service operates, and banks regulated by the federal government do not close for Good Friday. Some states, counties, municipalities, and territories observe the holiday. Good Friday is a state holiday in [Connecticut](/wiki/Connecticut), [Delaware](/wiki/Delaware), [Florida](/wiki/Florida), [Hawaii](/wiki/Hawaii), [Indiana](/wiki/Indiana), [Kentucky](/wiki/Kentucky) (half-day), [Louisiana](/wiki/Louisiana), [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey), [North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina), [North Dakota](/wiki/North_Dakota), [Tennessee](/wiki/Tennessee) and [Texas](/wiki/Texas), and in the territories of [Guam](/wiki/Guam), [U.S. Virgin Islands](/wiki/U.S._Virgin_Islands), [American Samoa](/wiki/American_Samoa), [Northern Mariana Islands](/wiki/Northern_Mariana_Islands) and [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico). State and local government offices and courts are closed, as well as some banks and post offices in these states,[*citation needed*] and in those counties and municipalities where Good Friday is observed as a holiday. The stock markets have chosen to be closed on Good Friday, but the foreign exchange and bond trading markets open for a partial business day. Some public schools and universities are closed on Good Friday if it falls within [spring break](/wiki/Spring_break). In some governmental contexts Good Friday has been referred to by a generic name such as \"spring holiday\". In 1999, in the case of *Bridenbaugh v. O'Bannon*, an Indiana state employee sued the governor for giving state employees Good Friday as a day off. The US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the plaintiff, stating that the government could give state employees a paid day off when that day is a religious holiday, including Good Friday, but only so long as the state can provide a valid secular purpose that coincides with the obvious religious purpose of the holiday. ## Calculating the date Dates for Good Friday 2019–2033 In Gregorian dates YearWesternEastern2019April 19April 262020April 10April 172021April 2April 302022April 15April 222023April 7April 142024March 29May 32025April 182026April 3April 102027March 26April 302028April 142029March 30April 62030April 19April 262031April 112032March 26April 302033April 15April 22 Good Friday is the Friday before Easter, which is calculated differently in [Eastern Christianity](/wiki/Eastern_Christianity) and [Western Christianity](/wiki/Western_Christianity) (see [Computus](/wiki/Computus) for details). Easter falls on the first Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon, the full moon on or after 21 March, taken to be the date of the vernal [equinox](/wiki/Equinox). The Western calculation uses the [Gregorian calendar](/wiki/Gregorian_calendar), while the Eastern calculation uses the [Julian calendar](/wiki/Julian_calendar), whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar's 3 April. The calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ.[*citation needed*] In Eastern Christianity, Easter can fall between 22 March and 25 April on Julian Calendar (thus between 4 April and 8 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar, during the period 1900 and 2099), so Good Friday can fall between 20 March and 23 April, inclusive (or between 2 April and 6 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar).[*citation needed*] ## Cultural references Good Friday assumes a particular importance in the plot of [Richard Wagner](/wiki/Richard_Wagner)'s music drama *[Parsifal](/wiki/Parsifal)*, which contains an orchestral interlude known as the \"Good Friday Music\". ## Memoration on Wednesday of the Holy Week Some [Baptist](/wiki/Baptist) congregations, the [Philadelphia Church of God](/wiki/Philadelphia_Church_of_God), and some [non-denominational](/wiki/Non-denominational_Christianity) churches oppose the observance of Good Friday, regarding it as a so-called \"[papist](/wiki/Papist)\" tradition, and instead observe the [Crucifixion of Jesus](/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus) on Wednesday to coincide with the Jewish sacrifice of the Passover Lamb (which some/many Christians believe is an Old Testament pointer to Jesus Christ). A Wednesday Crucifixion of Jesus allows for him to be in the tomb (\"heart of the earth\") for three days and three nights as he told the Pharisees he would be (Matthew 12:40), rather than two nights and a day (by [inclusive counting](/wiki/Counting#Inclusive_counting), as was the norm at that time) if he had died on a Friday. - Christianity portal - Holidays portal - [Good Friday Prayer](/wiki/Good_Friday_Prayer) - [Good Friday Prayer for the Jews](/wiki/Good_Friday_Prayer_for_the_Jews) - [Easter season](/wiki/Easter_season) - [Passion (music)](/wiki/Passion_(music)) - [Ascension of Jesus](/wiki/Ascension_of_Jesus) - [Life of Jesus in the New Testament](/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament) - [Salvation in Christianity](/wiki/Salvation_in_Christianity) - [Bellarmine, Robert](/wiki/Robert_Bellarmine) (1902). \"Good Friday: The Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ.\". *Sermons from the Latins*.
