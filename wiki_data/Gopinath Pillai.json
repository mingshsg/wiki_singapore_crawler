In 2012, Pillai was conferred the [Padma Shri](/wiki/Padma_Shri) by the [Indian government](/wiki/Government_of_India), the fourth highest Indian civilian award. ## Early life Pillai was born in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements) to K. S. Pillai, a journalist who ran a daily, *Kerala Bandhu*, known to be the only [Malayalam language](/wiki/Malayalam_language) daily published outside India. He spent eight years of his childhood in [Kerala](/wiki/Kerala), [India](/wiki/India), where his family is from, as he could not return to Singapore due to the outbreak of [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II). After the closure of the daily, his family finances dwindled and Pillai opted for a government-funded education. He graduated from the [University of Malaya](/wiki/University_of_Malaya) with a [Bachelor of Arts](/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts) degree in 1961 and was a member of the Socialist Club. ## Career Pillai started his career as a journalist with [Reuters](/wiki/Reuters) but had to abandon the job to fulfil his commitment to the government to work as a teacher, a prerequisite for availing government funding for education in Singapore. He subsequently joined [Bangkok Bank](/wiki/Bangkok_Bank) as an Economic Research Officer and worked as a correspondent for the *[Far Eastern Economic Review](/wiki/Far_Eastern_Economic_Review)*. He worked at the bank for five years before moving to Malaysian Industrial Development Finance Bhd as an economist, during which Singapore had become a separate country in 1965.

He later worked at United Industrial Corporation and then the State Trading Corporation for around 10 years in total. He has authored two books, *The History of Banking in Thailand* and *The Political Economy of South Asian Diaspora: Patterns of Socio-Economic Influence* in 2013.

Pillai launched KSP Group along with two of his friends, [Sat Pal Khattar](/wiki/Sat_Pal_Khattar) and Haider Sithawalla, and holds the post of a Director of the company. The company has since been rebranded as KSP Investments Private Limited, and serves as the holding company for Pillai's business investments. He is reported to have invested in a number of businesses and holds positions in many of them. He is the executive chairman of Savant Infocomm, an IT company, Playware Studios Pte Ltd and holds the chairmanship of companies such as Windmill International Private Limited and [Gateway Distriparks Limited](/wiki/Gateway_Distriparks_Limited) and one of its subsidiaries, Snowman Logistics Limited. He is the director of another Gateway Distriparks subsidiary, Gateway Rail Freight Limited and JTC Consultancy Services (Holdings) Private Limited. He is also the director of AEC Edu Group Private Limited and holds directorship of two of its subsidiaries, AEC College and AEC Education Plc. Pillai is the chairman of the Management Board of the Institute of South Asian Studies, a [National University of Singapore](/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore)-funded research institute. He also holds the post of the deputy chairman of Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital a healthcare centre in Singapore for rehabilitative care. ### Public career Pillai's diplomatic career started with his assignment with the Government Parliamentary Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs in the 1980s.
