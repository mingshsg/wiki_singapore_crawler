The company created and marketed the [Dextroscope](/wiki/Dextroscope), the first commercial surgical planning system that used virtual reality principles going beyond the mouse and keyboard. The [Dextroscope](/wiki/Dextroscope) introduced a variation of [Virtual Reality](/wiki/Virtual_reality) technology that didn't use Head-Mounted display (using instead a [stereoscopic display](/wiki/Stereoscopic_Displays_and_Applications) that housed a [two-handed 3D user interface](/wiki/3D_user_interface)) that provided a natural and comfortable interface to work with multi-modality 3D [medical images](/wiki/Medical_imaging) for long periods of time. This environment was applied to the planning of patient-specific surgical approaches for several clinical disciplines, including [neurosurgery](/wiki/Neurosurgery), [Ear-Nose-Throat](/wiki/Otorhinolaryngology), and liver surgery. The Dextroscope received world-wide attention by being involved in the planning of several [craniopagus](/wiki/Craniopagus_twins) twin separations, most notably the [Zambian twins](/wiki/Joseph_and_Luka_Banda) (1997) and the German twins (2004) at [Johns Hopkins Hospital](/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Hospital) led by Dr [Benjamin Carson](/wiki/Ben_Carson), and the Nepali twins separation at the [Singapore General Hospital](/wiki/Singapore_General_Hospital) in 2001. The Dextroscope was launched in Europe in 2000 and subsequently in Asia and the USA (2006). The company later introduced the [Dextrobeam](/wiki/Dextrobeam), a product designed to make 3D medical [stereoscopic presentations](/wiki/Stereoscopy) to large audiences, using stereoscopic projection systems. The company Quality Management System complied with the requirements of ISO 13485:2003 and the products were listed in the Singapore Medical Device Registration (SMDR) by the [Health Sciences Authority](/wiki/Health_Sciences_Authority) of Singapore.[*citation needed*] The [Dextroscope](/wiki/Dextroscope) and [Dextrobeam](/wiki/Dextrobeam) received USA FDA 510(K) - class II (2002) clearance, CE Marking - class I (2002), China SFDA Registration - class II (2004) and Taiwan Registration - type P (Radiology) (2007). The company was a spin-off company from the Kent Ridge Digital Labs research institute in Singapore. The company was founded in 2000 in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) by Luis Serra, Ng Hern, Ralf A Kockro, Eugene CK Lee and Chris Goh with seed capital from Life Sciences Investments (LSI) Pte Ltd., a co-investment fund of the Singapore Economic Development Board Investments Pte Ltd. (EDBI). It was later acquired by the Bracco Group in 2002. Volume Interactions ceased commercial operations in 2008.
