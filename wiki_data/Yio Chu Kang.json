Deriving its name from the Yio Chu Kang Village, it is still known for lush greenery and low-density housing with high-rise public housing in its southern fringes. ## Background The name Yio Chu Kang, similar to [Choa Chu Kang](/wiki/Choa_Chu_Kang) and [Lim Chu Kang](/wiki/Lim_Chu_Kang), derives from the term \"chu kang\" (厝港, [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_Romanization): cu3 gang2), meaning \"back port\". A chu kang was a settlement in backwater parts of rivers in Singapore which served as a port to ship out agricultural products, mainly [gambier](/wiki/Gambier_(extract)) and [pepper](/wiki/Black_pepper), grown on adjacent plantations under the [Kangchu economic system](/wiki/Kangchu_system) in 19th century [Johor](/wiki/Johor) and Singapore. ## Educational institutions ### Primary schools - Anderson Primary School ### Secondary schools - [Presbyterian High School](/wiki/Presbyterian_High_School) - [Yio Chu Kang Secondary School](/wiki/Yio_Chu_Kang_Secondary_School) ### Tertiary Institutions - [Nanyang Polytechnic](/wiki/Nanyang_Polytechnic) - [Anderson Serangoon Junior College](/wiki/Anderson_Serangoon_Junior_College) - [ITE College Central](/wiki/ITE_College_Central) ## Other amenities - [Yio Chu Kang Stadium](/wiki/Yio_Chu_Kang_Stadium) - Chu Sheng Temple - Swee Kow Kuan Temple - Yio Chu Kang Community Club Archived 2024-05-14 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine) ## Transportation Situated at the northern portion of [Ang Mo Kio](/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio), Yio Chu Kang is served by bus services originating from [Yio Chu Kang Bus Interchange](/wiki/Yio_Chu_Kang_Bus_Interchange), Seletar Bus Depot, [Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange](/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio_Bus_Interchange) and Yishun (85x services).
