The youngest death was a 10-year-old [primary school](/wiki/Education_in_Singapore) boy who had fallen into a flooded drain. ## Damage Total damage reached [S$](/wiki/S$)10 million, the worst flood since the [Hari Raya](/wiki/Hari_Raya) floods that hit the island in December 1969. 43 buses were badly damaged by the flood.
