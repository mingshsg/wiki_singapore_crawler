In 1997, this town became part of the expanded Buona Vista constituency as it was part of [Tanjong Pagar GRC](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar_Group_Representation_Constituency) when both GRCs merged but Clementi, West Coast, Pasir Panjang and Telok Blangah were carved out to form [West Coast GRC](/wiki/West_Coast_Group_Representation_Constituency). In 2001, Commonwealth itself and the entire Buona Vista ward were being carved out to form [Holland-Bukit Panjang GRC](/wiki/Holland-Bukit_Panjang_Group_Representation_Constituency) and subsequently [Holland-Bukit Timah GRC](/wiki/Holland-Bukit_Timah_Group_Representation_Constituency) in 2006. Since then, Buona Vista (including Commonwealth) has since returned to Tanjong Pagar GRC in 2011 and this constituency is currently helmed by the incumbent [Minister for Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)) [Chan Chun Sing](/wiki/Chan_Chun_Sing). Today, the entirety of Commonwealth (including Commonwealth Close and Crescent) is managed by Tanjong Pagar Town Council. - Singapore district This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
