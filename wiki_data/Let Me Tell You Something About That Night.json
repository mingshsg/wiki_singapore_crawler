  "content": "2009 short-story collection by Cyril Wong ***Let Me Tell You Something About That Night*** is a short-story collection by the Singaporean poet [Cyril Wong](/wiki/Cyril_Wong). His first published foray into prose and listed by [The Straits Times](/wiki/The_Straits_Times) as among the best five books of the year, described by the reviewer as possessing \"the sharp bite of contemporary issues\", the book \"takes fairytales and works them into a surreal lustre\" and \"gestures to a time before fairytales were saccharine fantasies\", while a few stories also deal openly with sexuality: \"The Boy with the Flower That Grew out of His Ass is a fable of wounding poignancy about homophobia; The Queen & Her Eventual Knowledge of Love is a post-mortem coming-out story.\" - [Singapore gay literature](/wiki/Singapore_gay_literature) - [Cyril Wong](/wiki/Cyril_Wong)\n",
