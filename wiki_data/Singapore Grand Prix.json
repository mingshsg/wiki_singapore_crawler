  "content": "Formula 1 Grand Prix in Singapore The **Singapore Grand Prix**[a] is a motor racing event which forms part of the [Formula One World Championship](/wiki/Formula_One_World_Championship). The event takes place on the [Marina Bay Street Circuit](/wiki/Marina_Bay_Street_Circuit) and was the inaugural night race and first street circuit in [Asia](/wiki/Asia) designed for [Formula One](/wiki/Formula_One) races. The original Singapore Grand Prix was held at Thomson Road from 1966 to 1973, before returning to the calendar in 2008 at Marina Bay. [Fernando Alonso](/wiki/Fernando_Alonso) won the inaugural [Formula One](/wiki/Formula_One) edition of the renewed Grand Prix, driving for the [Renault](/wiki/Renault_in_Formula_One) team amid controversial circumstances, when it emerged a year later that his teammate [Nelson Piquet Jr.](/wiki/Nelson_Piquet_Jr.) had been ordered to [crash on purpose](/wiki/Renault_Formula_One_crash_controversy) by senior team management to bring out the [safety car](/wiki/Safety_car) at a time chosen to benefit Alonso. The race was the 800th [Formula One World Championship](/wiki/Formula_One_World_Championship) race since its inception in 1950, and the first ever [Formula One](/wiki/Formula_One) race held at night. Until the [2024 race](/wiki/2024_Singapore_Grand_Prix), Marina Bay had featured at least one safety car in every race edition, with a total of 24 safety car deployments. The Singapore Grand Prix has been considered to be one of the most challenging and unique tracks on the Formula One calendar. [Sebastian Vettel](/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel) has the most wins on the track, with five victories. In 2022, a contract extension was announced to put the race on the Formula One calendar until at least 2028. ## History ### Formula Libre First organised in 1961, the race was initially known as the *Orient Year Grand Prix*, located at the [Thomson Road Grand Prix circuit](/wiki/Thomson_Road_Grand_Prix_circuit). It was renamed to the Singapore Grand Prix in 1966, shortly after Singapore became a sovereign country in 1965. The event was discontinued after 1973 and a variety of reasons have been suggested, including an increase in traffic, the very high danger and unsuitability of the track for racing, the inconvenience of having to close roads for the event and fatal accidents during the 1972 and 1973 races. ## Formula One Announced in 2008, an agreement for a five-year deal was signed by Singapore GP Pte Ltd, the [Singapore Tourism Board](/wiki/Singapore_Tourism_Board) and [Bernie Ecclestone](/wiki/Bernie_Ecclestone). In November 2007, it was announced that the [telecommunications](/wiki/Telecommunications) company [Singtel](/wiki/Singtel) would be the title sponsor of the event. The official name of the event became the Formula 1 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix. The race was co-funded by the [Government of Singapore](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore), footing 60% of the total bill, or S$90 million, out of a total tab of S$150 million. Around 110,000 tickets were made available for the country's first Formula One race. Corporate hospitality suites and packages went on sale at the end November 2007, three-day passes to the public went on sale in February 2008. Single-day passes went on sale a month later. The event went on to achieve a full sell-out for all of its tickets. The 2008 race hosted the Amber Lounge after-party and in 2010, Singapore became the second location to host the Amber Lounge Fashion show. ### 2008 The first race held at the new [Marina Bay Street Circuit](/wiki/Marina_Bay_Street_Circuit) was the 15th round of the 2008 [FIA](/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_l%27Automobile) [Formula One](/wiki/Formula_One) World Championship, and was also the first night-time event in [Formula One](/wiki/Formula_One) history. The timing of the night event also meant that it could be broadcast live at a convenient time for TV audiences outside of the Asia-Pacific. The track was also illuminated by a series of projectors which adapt their output to match the shape of the course. On track, [Felipe Massa](/wiki/Felipe_Massa) was the first man to sit on the Singapore pole in his Ferrari, and dominated the race until he was released early at a pit stop, breaking his fuel rig and dropping him to last place. The race was won by [Fernando Alonso](/wiki/Fernando_Alonso) driving for the [Renault](/wiki/Renault_in_Formula_One) team, though that result has since been tarnished by [controversy](/wiki/Renault_Formula_One_crash_controversy). Renault were found to have ordered [Nelson Piquet Jr.](/wiki/Nelson_Piquet_Jr.) to crash, as the ensuing safety car would strongly benefit Alonso. - [Pole position](/wiki/Pole_position): [Felipe Massa](/wiki/Felipe_Massa) ([Ferrari](/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari)) – 1:44.801 (174.055 km/h) - Race winner: [Fernando Alonso](/wiki/Fernando_Alonso) ([Renault](/wiki/Renault_in_Formula_One)) – 1:57:16.304 (61 laps) - Fastest lap: [Kimi Räikkönen](/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen) ([Ferrari](/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari)) – 1:45.599 (172.740 km/h) ### 2009 For the [2009 race](/wiki/2009_Singapore_Grand_Prix), the circuit was reprofiled slightly, including modifications to turns 1, 2 and 3 to aid overtaking, and also at turn 10 where high kerbs caused many accidents in (/wiki/2008_Singapore_Grand_Prix). [McLaren](/wiki/McLaren) driver and reigning World Champion [Lewis Hamilton](/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton) took pole position and sprinted away to win. [Timo Glock](/wiki/Timo_Glock) finished second for [Toyota](/wiki/Toyota_Racing_(Formula_One_team)), and [Fernando Alonso](/wiki/Fernando_Alonso) was third in the first race for Renault after they received a suspended disqualification from the sport for manipulating the previous year's race. - [Pole position](/wiki/Pole_position): [Lewis Hamilton](/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton) ([McLaren](/wiki/McLaren)) – 1:47.891 (169.270 km/h) - Race winner: [Lewis Hamilton](/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton) ([McLaren](/wiki/McLaren)) – 1:56:06.337 (61 laps) - Fastest lap: [Fernando Alonso](/wiki/Fernando_Alonso) ([Renault](/wiki/Renault_in_Formula_One)) – 1:48.240 (168.725 km/h) ### 2010 [Fernando Alonso](/wiki/Fernando_Alonso) became the first man to win twice in Singapore. Now at Ferrari, he took pole and resisted [Red Bull](/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing)'s [Sebastian Vettel](/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel) on his way to the 25th victory of his F1 career. [Michael Schumacher](/wiki/Michael_Schumacher), making his F1 comeback in (/wiki/2010_FIA_Formula_One_World_Championship), struggled in his Mercedes and was 13th, while [Heikki Kovalainen](/wiki/Heikki_Kovalainen) leapt from his burning [Lotus T127](/wiki/Lotus_T127), borrowed a fire extinguisher and put the fire out himself. - [Pole position](/wiki/Pole_position): [Fernando Alonso](/wiki/Fernando_Alonso) ([Ferrari](/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari)) – 1:45.390 (173.287 km/h) - Race winner: [Fernando Alonso](/wiki/Fernando_Alonso) ([Ferrari](/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari)) – 1:57:53.579 (61 laps) - Fastest lap: [Fernando Alonso](/wiki/Fernando_Alonso) ([Ferrari](/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari)) – 1:47.976 (169.137 km/h) ### 2011 [Sebastian Vettel](/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel), an eight-time winner in 2011 before Marina Bay, led the drivers' championship by over 100 points. He won the race from his 11th pole of the season. Vettel, Button, Webber, Alonso and Hamilton filled the top five places. [Michael Schumacher](/wiki/Michael_Schumacher) again struggled as he slammed into the [Sauber](/wiki/Sauber) of [Sergio Pérez](/wiki/Sergio_P%C3%A9rez). - [Pole position](/wiki/Pole_position): [Sebastian Vettel](/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel) ([Red Bull](/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing)) – 1:44.381 (174.962 km/h) - Race winner: [Sebastian Vettel](/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel) ([Red Bull](/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing)) – 1:59:06.757 (61 laps) - Fastest lap: [Jenson Button](/wiki/Jenson_Button) ([McLaren](/wiki/McLaren)) – 1:48.454 (168.392 km/h) ### 2012 On 22 September 2012, the AP reported that Bernie Ecclestone and the Singapore Grand Prix had agreed that the Grand Prix would remain on the Formula One calendar until 2017. [Lewis Hamilton](/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton) claimed his fifth pole of the season for [McLaren](/wiki/McLaren) and his second in Singapore. A surprise visitor to the front row alongside him was the [Williams](/wiki/Williams_Grand_Prix_Engineering) of [Pastor Maldonado](/wiki/Pastor_Maldonado), but it was [Sebastian Vettel](/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel)'s Red Bull that inherited the race lead when Hamilton pulled out with gearbox problems. Vettel then dedicated his 23rd Grand Prix win to [Sid Watkins](/wiki/Sid_Watkins), who had died shortly before the race. - [Pole position](/wiki/Pole_position): [Lewis Hamilton](/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton) ([McLaren](/wiki/McLaren)) – 1:46.362 (171.704 km/h) - Race winner: [Sebastian Vettel](/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel) ([Red Bull](/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing)) – 2:00:26.144 (59 laps) - Fastest lap: [Nico Hülkenberg](/wiki/Nico_H%C3%BClkenberg) ([Force India](/wiki/Force_India)) – 1:51.033 (164.480 km/h) ### 2013 For the 2013 race, it was announced that the 10th turn of the track, the \"Singapore Sling\" chicane, would be reconfigured so the cars would have to navigate a flowing left-hander before accelerating towards the Anderson Bridge. [Sebastian Vettel](/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel) took his third successive win in Singapore with [Red Bull](/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing) and the 33rd of his career as a fourth straight title also loomed. He did it from his second Singapore pole, recovering from the surprise of seeing [Nico Rosberg](/wiki/Nico_Rosberg)'s [Mercedes](/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One) briefly ahead at race start to take victory by over half a minute. [Fernando Alonso](/wiki/Fernando_Alonso) was on the podium yet again before stopping his Ferrari to pick up [Mark Webber](/wiki/Mark_Webber_(racing_driver)), whose Red Bull was in flames at Turn 7. - [Pole position](/wiki/Pole_position): [Sebastian Vettel](/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel) ([Red Bull](/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing)) – 1:42.841 (177.302 km/h) - Race winner: [Sebastian Vettel](/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel) ([Red Bull](/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing)) – 1:59:13.132 (61 laps) - Fastest lap: [Sebastian Vettel](/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel) ([Red Bull](/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing)) – 1:48.574 (167.574 km/h) ### 2014 On 15 April 2014, it was announced that [Singapore Airlines](/wiki/Singapore_Airlines) would sponsor the Singapore Grand Prix, starting from that year. F1's new-generation turbo-charged, hybrid-powered cars brought a new look to the track, ending the reign of the 2.4-litre power unit, but a controversial ban on radio communications dominated pre-race proceedings. [Mercedes](/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One)'s [Lewis Hamilton](/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton) sailed to his seventh win of the year, becoming Singapore's third multiple winner in the process as teammate [Nico Rosberg](/wiki/Nico_Rosberg) retired with technical problems. [Sebastian Vettel](/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel), bound for [Ferrari](/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari) in 2015, finished second ahead of new [Red Bull](/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing) partner [Daniel Ricciardo](/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo). - [Pole position](/wiki/Pole_position): [Lewis Hamilton](/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton) ([Mercedes](/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One)) – 1:45.681 (172.538 km/h) - Race winner: [Lewis Hamilton](/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton) ([Mercedes](/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One)) – 2:00:04.795 (60 laps) - Fastest lap: [Lewis Hamilton](/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton) ([Mercedes](/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One)) – 1:50.417 (165.137 km/h) ### 2015\n",
