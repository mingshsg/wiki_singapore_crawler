  "content": "Spherical sweet from the Indian subcontinent **Laddu** or **laddoo** is a spherical sweet from the [Indian subcontinent](/wiki/Indian_subcontinent) made of various ingredients and [sugar syrup](/wiki/Sugar_syrup) or [jaggery](/wiki/Jaggery). It has been described as \"perhaps the most universal and ancient of [Indian sweets](/wiki/Sweets_from_the_Indian_subcontinent).\" Laddus are often served during celebrations and religious festivals, especially those associated with the [Hindu](/wiki/Hindu) deity [Ganesha](/wiki/Ganesha). ## History and etymology The word *laddu* is derived from a [Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit) term meaning \"small ball.\" In the 3rd-4th century [Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit) medical text *[Sushruta Samhita](/wiki/Sushruta_Samhita)*, ladduka are described as small balls of jaggery, [peanuts](/wiki/Peanut), and [sesame seeds](/wiki/Sesame_seeds) coated with [honey](/wiki/Honey). These balls were used as an [antiseptic](/wiki/Antiseptic) and to [deliver](/wiki/Oral_administration) medication. However, the first documented mention of laddu as a sweet is in the 11th-century [Western Indian](/wiki/Western_India) cookbook [*Lokopakara*](/wiki/Indian_cookbooks). It gives a recipe for making laddus with [shavige](/wiki/Sevai) (rice vermicelli), ghee, and sugar syrup, which were formed into balls and fried in ghee. The 15th-century Indian cookbook *[Nimatnama-i-Nasiruddin-Shahi](/wiki/Nimatnama-i-Nasiruddin-Shahi)* gives several recipes for laddus made with [white flour](/wiki/White_flour), [dried fruits](/wiki/Dried_fruits), [rosewater](/wiki/Rosewater), [camphor](/wiki/Camphor), and [musk](/wiki/Musk). ## Varieties ### Besan laddu Besan laddu is the most common variety. To prepare it, [besan](/wiki/Besan) (chickpea flour) is fried in hot [ghee](/wiki/Ghee) (clarified butter). Sugar and [cardamom](/wiki/Cardamom) powder are then mixed in. The mixture is formed into balls and allowed to cool and solidify. ### Motichoor laddu Motichoor (\"crushed pearls\" in [Hindi](/wiki/Hindi)) laddu is made from [boondi](/wiki/Boondi), tiny fried balls of chickpea batter soaked in sugar syrup. ### Thaggu ke laddu Thaggu ke (\"Cheat's\") laddu is made from [khoa](/wiki/Khoa) (condensed milk), [semolina](/wiki/Semolina), and [white sugar](/wiki/White_sugar) and is a specialty of [Kanpur](/wiki/Kanpur), India. It was invented by Mattha Pandey, a follower of [Mahatma Gandhi](/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi). Pandey heard Gandhi refer to white sugar, which was popularized in India by the British, as \"white poison\" and disease-causing. Since his laddu was made with white sugar, he named it accordingly. ### Shahi laddu Shahi (royal) laddu is made from the sweets [peda](/wiki/Peda) and [barfi](/wiki/Barfi), which are ground into a paste, mixed with cardamom, dried fruits, and nuts, and formed into balls. It is decorated with [vark](/wiki/Vark) (edible foil). ### Coconut laddu [Coconut](/wiki/Coconut) laddu originated in the medieval [Chola Empire](/wiki/Chola_Empire), when it was packed for travelers and warriors for good luck on their expeditions. ### Gond ke laddu Gond ke laddu is made from roasted and powdered [gond](/wiki/Gum_arabic) (gum arabic), ghee, jaggery, and sometimes *battisa* or *keoka* powder. It is commonly served in North India as a [postpartum](/wiki/Postpartum) food. ### Temple laddus Some [Hindu temples](/wiki/Hindu_temples) have their own laddu versions, which are offered to the deities and then served to devotees as [prasada](/wiki/Prasada) (sanctified food). The besan laddu served in the [Venkateswara Temple](/wiki/Venkateswara_Temple) in [Tirupati](/wiki/Tirupati), India, has been called \"the most famous temple laddu.\" The [Maa Tarini Temple](/wiki/Maa_Tarini_Temple,_Ghatgaon) in [Ghatgaon](/wiki/Ghatgaon), India serves laddus made from coconut and [khoa](/wiki/Khoa). The special laddu at the [Subramaniya Swamy Temple](/wiki/Subramaniya_Swamy_Temple,_Tiruchendur) in [Tiruchendur](/wiki/Tiruchendur), India is made from [foxtail millet](/wiki/Foxtail_millet). ### Others Every region of India has its own version of laddu. In [Rajasthan](/wiki/Rajasthan), laddus are made from [wheat flour](/wiki/Wheat_flour), in [Maharashtra](/wiki/Maharashtra) from [sesame seeds](/wiki/Sesame_seeds), in [Kerala](/wiki/Kerala) from [rice flour](/wiki/Rice_flour), and in [Andhra Pradesh](/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh) from [rice flakes](/wiki/Rice_flakes). Optional ingredients include [grated coconut](/wiki/Grated_coconut), roasted chickpeas, [nuts](/wiki/Nut_(fruit)), and [raisins](/wiki/Raisins). ## World record According to *[Guinness World Records](/wiki/Guinness_World_Records)*, the world's largest laddu to date was created by PVVS Mallikharjuna Rao in [Tapeswaram](/wiki/Tapeswaram), [Andhra Pradesh](/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh), India in 2016. It weighed 29,465 kilograms (64,959 pounds) and was made using a traditional boondi recipe with ghee, oil, cashews, sugar, almonds, cardamom, and water. ## In popular culture In the *[Sesame Street](/wiki/Sesame_Street)* episode \"Rakhi Road\", [Elmo](/wiki/Elmo) is shown eating laddus. - [Tirupati laddu](/wiki/Tirupati_laddu) - [Sweets from the Indian subcontinent](/wiki/Sweets_from_the_Indian_subcontinent) - [List of Indian sweets and desserts](/wiki/List_of_Indian_sweets_and_desserts)\n",
