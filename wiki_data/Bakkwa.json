  "content": "Salty-sweet dried meat product **Bakkwa** ([simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 肉干; [traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 肉乾; [Pe̍h-ōe-jī](/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB): *bah-koaⁿ*; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *ròugān*) is a [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_cuisine) salty-sweet [dried meat](/wiki/Dried_meat) product similar to [jerky](/wiki/Jerky). Bakkwa is made with a [meat preservation](/wiki/Meat_preservation) and preparation technique originating from [China](/wiki/China). The general method of production has remained virtually unchanged throughout the centuries, but the techniques have been gradually improved. It is traditionally made of [pork](/wiki/Pork), [beef](/wiki/Beef), or [mutton](/wiki/Mutton), which is prepared with spices, sugar, salt and soy sauce, then dried on racks at around 50 to 60 °C (122 to 140 °F) to a final [water activity](/wiki/Water_activity) between 0.60 and 0.69. Nowadays, products with a softer texture, lighter color and less sugar are preferred. The *shafu* type of bakkwa products has a higher water content, and thus has a softer texture and lower sugar content. Whereas the traditional bakkwa has a [water activity](/wiki/Water_activity) below 0.7, *shafu* bakkwa tends to be closer to a water activity of about 0.79. Nevertheless, *shafu* can have a similar shelf life to other types of bakkwa. Bakkwa is very popular in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) and [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) where it is traditionally eaten during the [Chinese New Year](/wiki/Chinese_New_Year). When Chinese immigrants brought this delicacy over to Singapore and Malaysia, it began to take on local characteristics. A notable example lies in the preparation of bakkwa, where the meat is grilled over charcoal rather than air-dried, imparting a smokier flavor to the meat. The Singaporean and Malaysian versions of bakkwa are also sweeter than their mainland China counterparts with many different variations having developed to suit local palates, such as chili bakkwa. - [Bee Cheng Hiang](/wiki/Bee_Cheng_Hiang) - [Dendeng](/wiki/Dendeng) - [Dried shredded squid](/wiki/Dried_shredded_squid) - [Rousong](/wiki/Rousong) Listen to this article (2 minutes)was created from a revision of this article dated 7 May 2019 (2019-05-07), and does not reflect subsequent edits.(Audio help · More spoken articles)Portals: - Food - Asia\n",
