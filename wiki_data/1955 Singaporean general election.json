It marked a pivotal moment in Singapore's political development, being the first election conducted under the [Rendel Constitution](/wiki/Rendel_Constitution), which introduced a significantly expanded legislature with a majority of elected seats. Of the 32 seats in the new Legislative Assembly, 25 were contested by election, while the remainder were filled by nominated or *[ex-officio](/wiki/Ex-officio)* members. The election featured multiple new political parties and was the first to witness widespread participation by locally founded political organisations. The election resulted in a [hung assembly](/wiki/Hung_assembly), with the [Labour Front](/wiki/Labour_Front) (LF), a newly formed [centre-left](/wiki/Centre-left) party led by [David Marshall](/wiki/David_Marshall_(Singaporean_politician)), emerging as the largest party with 10 seats. The [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP), contesting its first general election under the leadership of [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew), won 3 seats, while the [Progressive Party](/wiki/Progressive_Party_(Singapore)) (PP), the largest party in the previous [Legislative Council](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_Singapore), suffered a significant decline, securing only 4 seats. Marshall was appointed Singapore's first [Chief Minister](/wiki/Chief_Minister_of_Singapore) after forming a [minority government](/wiki/First_David_Marshall_Cabinet) with the support of the Singapore branches of the [United Malays National Organisation](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation) (UMNO), the [Malayan Chinese Association](/wiki/Malayan_Chinese_Association) (MCA) and several independents. The 1955 election was significant in setting the stage for the [self-governance of Singapore](/wiki/Self-governance_of_Singapore). It introduced a partially elected government responsible for internal affairs, though the British colonial authorities retained control over external affairs, defence and internal security. With more than 300,000 registered voters, the 1955 election saw a significant surge in voter registration compared to the (/wiki/1948_Singaporean_general_election) and (/wiki/1951_Singaporean_general_election) elections. However, voter turnout remained relatively low at 52.66%. The outcome of the election underscored the fragmentation and diversity of political opinion at the time as well as the rising tide of anti-colonial sentiment that would shape Singapore's future political trajectory. ## Background Following the promulgation of the [Rendel Constitution](/wiki/Rendel_Constitution), the 1955 elections marked the first occasion in which a majority of the Legislative Assembly seats were filled by election rather than appointment by the British colonial authorities. The new constitution was drafted based on recommendations from a committee headed by [George William Rendel](/wiki/George_William_Rendel), aimed at granting greater autonomy to local citizens. Under the new constitutional framework, executive power was shared between local elected representatives and the British colonial administration, with the introduction of the position of Chief Minister, who would be selected from among the elected legislators. The number of elected seats was increased to 25, while the British government retained the authority to appoint the remaining seven members. For the first time, political parties were allowed to adopt a standard symbol for all their candidates, and independent candidates could choose their own symbols instead of relying on a ballot system. Additionally, the Colonial Secretary were replaced by the [Chief Secretary](/wiki/Chief_Secretary_(Singapore)), who was granted the power to appoint four nominated Assembly members. Several seats were removed from the legislature, including those held by the Solicitor-General, two directors, two *ex officio* members, representatives of the three commercial organisations (Singapore, Chinese and Indian) and the City Council. ## Timeline DateEvent5 FebruaryDissolution of the Legislative Council28 FebruaryNomination Day2 AprilPolling day6 AprilInauguration of David Marshall as Chief Minister7 AprilFormation of Council of Ministers22 AprilOpening of [1st Legislative Assembly](/wiki/1st_Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore) ## Changes in electoral boundaries ConstituencyDivisions formed from[Bukit Panjang](/wiki/Bukit_Panjang_Single_Member_Constituency)Bukit Timah & Seletar[Cairnhill](/wiki/Cairnhill_Single_Member_Constituency)Balestier, Rochore & Tanglin[Farrer Park](/wiki/Farrer_Park_Single_Member_Constituency)Balestier[Geylang](/wiki/Geylang_Constituency)Katong[Havelock](/wiki/Havelock_Single_Member_Constituency)City, Keppel & Tanglin[Kampong Kapor](/wiki/Kampong_Kapor_Single_Member_Constituency)Rochore[Pasir Panjang](/wiki/Pasir_Panjang_Single_Member_Constituency)Bukit Timah & Keppel[Paya Lebar](/wiki/Paya_Lebar_Single_Member_Constituency)Changi & Katong[Punggol–Tampines](/wiki/Punggol%E2%80%93Tampines_Single_Member_Constituency)Changi[Queenstown](/wiki/Queenstown_Single_Member_Constituency)Bukit Timah, Keppel & Tanglin[Sembawang](/wiki/Sembawang_Single_Member_Constituency)Bukit Timah & Seletar[Serangoon](/wiki/Serangoon_Single_Member_Constituency)Balestier, Changi & Seletar[Southern Islands](/wiki/Southern_Islands_Single_Member_Constituency)Bukit Timah & Keppel[Stamford](/wiki/Stamford_Single_Member_Constituency)City & Rochore[Tanjong Pagar](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar_Single_Member_Constituency)City & Keppel[Telok Ayer](/wiki/Telok_Ayer_Single_Member_Constituency)City[Tiong Bahru](/wiki/Tiong_Bahru_Single_Member_Constituency)Keppel[Ulu Bedok](/wiki/Ulu_Bedok_Single_Member_Constituency)Changi[Whampoa](/wiki/Whampoa_Single_Member_Constituency)Balestier ## Results Although many British observers had expected the [Progressive Party](/wiki/Progressive_Party_(Singapore)) (PP) to win the election and for its leader [Tan Chye Cheng](/wiki/Tan_Chye_Cheng) to be appointed [Chief Minister](/wiki/Chief_Minister_of_Singapore), the outcome proved to be a major [upset](/wiki/Upset_(competition)). The newly formed [Labour Front](/wiki/Labour_Front) (LF) emerged with the largest number of seats, and its chairman [David Marshall](/wiki/David_Marshall_(Singaporean_politician)) was appointed instead after unseating Tan at [Cairnhill](/wiki/Cairnhill_Single_Member_Constituency). When including two nominated members aligned with the party, the LF held 12 seats. It subsequently formed a [minority government](/wiki/Minority_government) with the Singapore branches of the [United Malays National Organisation](/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation) (UMNO) and the [Malayan Chinese Association](/wiki/Malayan_Chinese_Association) (MCA), each holding one seat, along with the support of the three *ex-officio* members of the Assembly, the [Chief Secretary](/wiki/Chief_Secretary_of_Singapore) [William Goode](/wiki/William_Goode_(colonial_administrator)), [Attorney-General](/wiki/Attorney-General_of_Singapore) [John Davies](/wiki/John_Davies_(judge)) and Financial Secretary [Thomas Hart](/wiki/Thomas_Hart_(civil_servant)). This alliance commanded a slim majority of 17 out of 32 seats in the Assembly. This election remains unique in Singapore's political history as the only general election to have resulted in a coalition government, the only occasion on which there was a [hung legislature](/wiki/Hung_parliament) and the only time ever since that a ruling government was not formed by the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP). On the opposition side, the newly established PAP, led by lawyer and former PP election agent [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew), deliberately contested only a limited number of constituencies as a protest against the [Rendel Constitution](/wiki/Rendel_Constitution). After the election, independent candidate [Ahmad Ibrahim](/wiki/Ahmad_Ibrahim_(Singaporean_politician)) joined the PAP, bringing its representation in the Assembly to four members. Lee won [Tanjong Pagar](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar_Single_Member_Constituency) with 78.33% of the votes, one of the highest margins in the election, and later remarked that he had also considered contesting [Tanglin](/wiki/Tanglin_Single_Member_Constituency), but chose Tanjong Pagar due to its strong dockworker base and welfare networks. Although the electorate had expanded more than sixfold compared to previous elections, this remained the last general election to date in which voting was not compulsory. [Voter turnout](/wiki/Voter_turnout) increased only marginally to 52.66%, a rise of 0.61%. [Southern Islands](/wiki/Southern_Islands_Constituency) recorded the highest turnout at 70%, while six constituencies saw turnouts below 50%, with [Geylang](/wiki/Geylang_Constituency) registering the lowest at 41%. In contrast, the lowest turnout in the [1951 election](/wiki/1951_Singaporean_general_election) had been [City](/wiki/City_Constituency), at 44%. This was also the last general election where no party contested every seat. The best-performing candidate was [Lim Yew Hock](/wiki/Lim_Yew_Hock) of the LF, a future Chief Minister, who secured 86% of the vote and won by a margin of 79 percentage points. At the other end of the spectrum, independent candidate Chua Kim Watt received just 0.55% of the vote in [Farrer Park](/wiki/Farrer_Park_Constituency), making him the worst-performing candidate. The narrowest winning margin was recorded by [Malay Union](/wiki/Malay_Union) candidate [Inche Sidik](/wiki/Inche_Sidik), who won by just 1.15 percentage points. Ten candidates forfeited their $500 [election deposits](/wiki/Election_deposits) after failing to secure the required vote threshold.
