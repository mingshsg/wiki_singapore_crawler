  "content": "Theatre located in Balestier, Singapore **Ruby Theatre**, also known as the **Ruby Cinema**, was a theatre located along Balestier Road in [Balestier](/wiki/Balestier), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). ## History The theatre first opened on 17 September 1958, along Balestier Road in [Balestier](/wiki/Balestier), and was owned by the [Cathay Organisation](/wiki/Cathay_Organisation). The theatre was popular in the 1970s, with tickets for some performances being completely sold out. Due to this, a policy was implemented where only four tickets could be bought at a time. The theatre offer was given to Golden Wall Realty in 1980, in which a new complex would be built on the site of the theatre, with a new cinema, which was to be handed back to Cathay Theatres. The offer was accepted, and the theatre later closed and was demolished in 1980, later being replaced by [Balestier Point](/wiki/Balestier_Point) in 1986. 1°19′22″N 103°50′59″E﻿ / ﻿1.3227°N 103.8497°E﻿ / 1.3227; 103.8497 This article about a Singapore building or structure is a stub.
