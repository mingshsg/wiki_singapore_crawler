  "content": "Biennial aerospace event held in Singapore The **Singapore Airshow** is a biennial [aerospace](/wiki/Aerospace) event held in Singapore, which debuted in 2008. It hosts high-level government and military delegations, as well as senior corporate executives around the world, while serving as a global event for leading aerospace companies and budding players (including [start-ups](/wiki/Startup_company)) to make their mark in the [international aerospace and defence market](/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer). ## Status Formerly known as **Changi International Airshow**, the Singapore Airshow was launched as a partnership between Singaporean agencies [Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore](/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority_of_Singapore) and the [Defence Science and Technology Agency](/wiki/Defence_Science_and_Technology_Agency) after the relocation of [Asian Aerospace](/wiki/Asian_Aerospace) from [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). The event offers conferences, forums and co-located events. It is cited to be the third largest air show in the world after [Le Bourget](/wiki/Paris_Air_Show) and [Farnborough](/wiki/Farnborough_International_Airshow), as well as [Asia](/wiki/Asia)'s largest air show, although this is disputed by the [Dubai Airshow](/wiki/Dubai_Airshow). ## Venue The selected venue for the permanent site of the Singapore Airshow is situated on a plot of land just beyond the northern edge [perimeter fencing](/wiki/Perimeter_fencing) of [Changi Air Base](/wiki/Changi_Air_Base_(East)), which was itself located due east of the nearby [Singapore Changi Airport](/wiki/Changi_Airport). In 2006, a contract worth [S$](/wiki/S$)60 million was awarded to Eng Lim Construction to begin the building of the new exhibition site to replace the [Changi International Exhibition and Convention Centre](/wiki/Changi_International_Exhibition_and_Convention_Centre), including a main exhibition hall with 40,000 square metres of space. When completed in September 2007, the New Changi Exhibition Centre had a 40,000 square metres of exhibition hall, 2,000 [parking lots](/wiki/Parking_lots) for trade visitors and motorists as well as 100,000 square metres of outdoor space for exhibitions and functions. Upon its completion, the hall was promptly named as the [Changi Exhibition Centre](/wiki/Changi_Exhibition_Centre) to set it apart from the [Changi International Exhibition and Convention Centre](/wiki/Changi_International_Exhibition_and_Convention_Centre) which had been in use by the [Asian Aerospace](/wiki/Asian_Aerospace) exhibitions from 1988 to 2006. The old site is a good 2 kilometres due west of the current one. ## 2008 The inaugural show was held from 19 to 24 February 2008, with the first four days reserved for trade visitors at the purpose-built Changi Exhibition Centre in [Changi](/wiki/Changi). Besides the usual exhibits and static displays, the event saw the return of aerobatic flying displays put up by the [Airbus A380](/wiki/Airbus_A380), [Black Knights](/wiki/RSAF_Black_Knights) of the [Republic of Singapore Air Force](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force) and the [Roulettes](/wiki/Roulettes) of the [Royal Australian Air Force](/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force). Also held concurrently are several seminars and conferences, including the Singapore Airshow Aviation Leadership Summit, the Global Air Power Conference, the International Defence Procurement Conference, the C4I Asia Conference and the Global Space and Technology Convention. The static displays included several themed exhibition pavilions, including the Airport Pavilion and the Integrated Land Defence Pavilion. The ATW Airline Industry Achievement Awards was also held during the Airshow. A minor incident occurred when Airshow organizers required [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwan) aerospace company [Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation](/wiki/Aerospace_Industrial_Development_Corporation) to erase Taiwanese symbols displayed on their stand at the request of [Chinese government](/wiki/Chinese_government) officials. ### Aircraft orders - [Garuda Indonesia](/wiki/Garuda_Indonesia): Conversion of an earlier order for six Boeing 777-200 to ten Boeing 777-300ER, worth US$2 billion - [Korean Air](/wiki/Korean_Air): Three Airbus A380-800 worth US$906 million - [Lion Air](/wiki/Lion_Air): 56 Boeing 737-900ERs with purchase rights for a further 50 aircraft worth US$4.4 billion - BJets: launch of new Singapore-based airline, and a US$500 million deal to purchase twenty [Cessna](/wiki/Cessna) [Citation CJ2+](/wiki/Cessna_Citation_CJ2) business jets ### Other announcements - [Air Caraibes](/wiki/Air_Caraibes): Selection of [Pratt & Whitney PW4000](/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_PW4000)-100 engines for its three Airbus A330-300 aircraft worth over US$180 million - [Grupo Marsans](/wiki/Grupo_Marsans): Selection of Pratt & Whitney PW4000-100 engines for its five Airbus A330 aircraft worth over US$285 million - [Jetstar Asia](/wiki/Jetstar_Asia): Selection of Global Service Partners to maintain V2500-A5 engines - JAT Tehnika: Selection of Pratt & Whitney to maintain CFM56-3 engines - [Etihad Airways](/wiki/Etihad_Airways): Addition of four new Indian destinations, namely [Chennai](/wiki/Chennai), [Jaipur](/wiki/Jaipur), [Kolkata](/wiki/Kolkata) and [Kozhikode](/wiki/Kozhikode) - [Tiger Airways](/wiki/Tiger_Airways): Selected [International Aero Engines](/wiki/International_Aero_Engines) to supply V2500 engines for 20 [Airbus A320](/wiki/Airbus_A320) planes, worth US$580 million ## 2010 Singapore Airshow 2010, held at the Changi Exhibition Centre from 2 to 7 February 2010, featured more than 800 exhibiting companies from over 40 countries.

It subsequently crashed and caught fire. The fire was put out by emergency services and the pilot was treated for minor injuries. Following an investigation, the crash was determined to be due to pilot error. ## 2020 The Singapore Airshow 2020 was held from 11 to 16 February 2020. Because of COVID-19 pandemic, many exhibitors pulled out and public were restricted from entering. The USAF [F-22 Raptor Demo Team](/wiki/F-22_Raptor_Demo_Team) performed at the airshow for the first time. ## 2022 The Singapore Airshow 2022 was held from 15 to 18 February 2022 with no public days.

The airshow received calls for protests in the wake of the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war). In response, the [Singapore Police Force](/wiki/Singapore_Police_Force) warned that such protests or public assemblies would be illegal. A group of Chinese tourists were prohibited from entering into a [German Air Force](/wiki/German_Air_Force) [Airbus A400M](/wiki/Airbus_A400M) military transport due to military restrictions. In response, Airbus posted a statement in the Chinese social media platform [Weibo](/wiki/Weibo) apologising for what happened and stated that they \"improved the visit process, and ensured that the aircraft was open to all visitors.\" The contents of a virtual [WebEx](/wiki/Cisco_Webex) meeting of senior German air force officials was leaked by Russian sources, because one officer dialled in from the airshow via an unsecure line. - Singapore Airshow official website - Video of RSAF Black Knights performing at the Singapore Airshow 2008 - Black Knights official website - Roulettes official website\n",
