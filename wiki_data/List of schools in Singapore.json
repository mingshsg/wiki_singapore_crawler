  "content": "Singapore's public schools come under the purview of the [Ministry of Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)). Singapore has many [primary schools](/wiki/Primary_school) and [secondary schools](/wiki/Secondary_school), as well as junior colleges, centralised institutes, [polytechnics](/wiki/Institute_of_technology) and universities providing [tertiary education](/wiki/Tertiary_education). Under the Compulsory Education Act which came into effect on 1 January 2003, all children have to start attending primary school at the age of 7. It is a criminal offence to fail to do so; however, parents may apply for an exemption from the Ministry of Education for their child to be [homeschooled](/wiki/Homeschooling) or to attend full-time religious institutions. ## Primary schools ## Secondary schools ## Junior Colleges and Millennia Institute Below is a list of schools offering a two or three-year pre-university education in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), along with the special programmes offered by the schools. The year of establishment in this article reflects the year in which the pre-university programme is implemented, particularly for the [Integrated Programme](/wiki/Integrated_Programme) High Schools. All pre-university programmes in Singapore are mixed-sex in tandem with the [Ministry of Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore))'s (MOE) requirements. These schools can be divided into two groups: junior colleges and centralised institutes. ### Junior colleges (JC) These offer two-year courses leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'A' Level or International Baccalaureate examinations.

[ITE College East](/wiki/ITE_College_East) was the first to open in [Simei](/wiki/Simei) in January 2005, and the existing \"ITE East Network\" campuses were renamed as \"[ITE College Central](/wiki/ITE_College_Central)\" campuses, to be replaced by a new campus in [Ang Mo Kio](/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio). \"ITE West Network\" campuses were renamed \"[ITE College West](/wiki/ITE_College_West)\" campuses, and their new campus will be at [Choa Chu Kang](/wiki/Choa_Chu_Kang). - **[ITE College Central](/wiki/ITE_College_Central)** (Regional Campus at [Ang Mo Kio](/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio)) - **[ITE College West](/wiki/ITE_College_West)** (Regional Campus at [Choa Chu Kang](/wiki/Choa_Chu_Kang)) - **[ITE College East](/wiki/ITE_College_East)** (Regional Campus at [Simei](/wiki/Simei)) ## University of the Arts Singapore In March 2021, Minister for Education [Lawrence Wong](/wiki/Lawrence_Wong) announced that Singapore’s first arts university will be established in an alliance between the [Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts](/wiki/Nanyang_Academy_of_Fine_Arts) and [LASALLE College of the Arts](/wiki/LASALLE_College_of_the_Arts), in a system akin to the [University of the Arts, London](/wiki/University_of_the_Arts,_London). The formation of the [University of the Arts Singapore](/wiki/University_of_the_Arts_Singapore) (UAS) will see both colleges under the umbrella university be given degree-awarding powers independent of their current foreign partners, where the current long-distance degrees are issued through foreign universities. Singaporeans and permanent residents (PRs) enrolled in the approved degree programmes at the university of the arts will pay subsidised fees, comparable to those at autonomous universities here. The seventh local university of Singapore will be the only publicly-funded private university other than the now defunct and restructured [UniSIM](/wiki/UniSIM) in Singapore, and also the only university of the arts with its own degree-conferring power in Singapore slated to open in 2024.
