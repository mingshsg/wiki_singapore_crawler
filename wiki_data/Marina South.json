  "content": "Planning Area in Central, Singapore **Marina South** is a [planning area](/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore) located within the [Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore) of the [Central Region](/wiki/Central_Region,_Singapore) of Singapore. It is largely home to [Gardens by the Bay](/wiki/Gardens_by_the_Bay) as well as the [Marina Barrage](/wiki/Marina_Barrage). The name has also been used to refer to the larger [peninsula](/wiki/Peninsula) the planning area is situated on, which encompasses the planning areas of [Straits View](/wiki/Straits_View) and a portion of the [Downtown Core](/wiki/Downtown_Core). Marina South is bordered by [Marina East](/wiki/Marina_East) to the north and northeast, [Straits View](/wiki/Straits_View) to the southwest, the [Downtown Core](/wiki/Downtown_Core) to the north and west, as well as the [Singapore Straits](/wiki/Singapore_Straits) to the south and east. ## History ### Reclamation and leisure activities in the 1990s Land at [Marina Centre](/wiki/Marina_Centre) and Marina South was [reclaimed](/wiki/Land_reclamation) from the sea to form a sheltered body of water that came to be known as [Marina Bay](/wiki/Marina_Bay,_Singapore). It was aimed to provide additional land near the Central Business District. After allowing for the reclaimed land to settle, the area was developed to allow kite flying and the playing of soccer as an interim measure. A park known as [Marina City Park](/wiki/Marina_City_Park) was opened on 30 December 1990, was planned to be a premier park of Singapore's proposed \"city of the 21st century\". Commercial districts were also constructed to allow outdoor [dining](/wiki/Dining), [bowling alleys](/wiki/Bowling_alley) and [gaming arcades](/wiki/Video_arcade). In its hey-day back in the early 1990s, teenagers flocked to the area as there used to be Singapore's only Cantonese discothèque – Canto. All of these were closed in the mid-2000s as redevelopment was planned for the area. ### Re-development A new [ferry terminal](/wiki/Ferry_terminal), [Marina South Pier](/wiki/Marina_South_Pier), was built there to replace the old [Clifford Pier](/wiki/Clifford_Pier) at [Collyer Quay](/wiki/Collyer_Quay), it was opened on 1 April 2006. The Marina City Park was later closed from 1 June 2007 for the [Gardens by the Bay](/wiki/Gardens_by_the_Bay)'s site preparatory works. An [integrated resort](/wiki/Integrated_resort), [Marina Bay Sands](/wiki/Marina_Bay_Sands), was built on the northern shore of Marina South which was completed in 2010. It is situated next to the Gardens by the Bay and the [Marina Bay Financial Centre](/wiki/Marina_Bay_Financial_Centre), which was completed in 2013. The new [Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore](/wiki/Marina_Bay_Cruise_Centre_Singapore), was built and opened in October 2012. It is located next to the current [Marina South Pier](/wiki/Marina_South_Pier). It has the capability to accommodate some of the world's largest ships. The addition of the new cruise centre helps to boost the growth of the leisure cruise sector in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), apart from the [Singapore Cruise Centre](/wiki/Singapore_Cruise_Centre). ## Future Marina South was first identified by the URA in 2013 as a car-lite high density residential district next to the new Central Business District at [Marina Bay, Singapore](/wiki/Marina_Bay,_Singapore). The precinct, which can yield more than 10,000 homes, will also feature retail, office and hotel uses, creating a self-sufficient community. It will also form part of the [Greater Southern Waterfront](/wiki/Greater_Southern_Waterfront). The first land parcel, a residential plot on Marina Gardens Lane, will be released for sale in December 2022. ## Transport Marina South is served by three stations, [Marina Bay](/wiki/Marina_Bay_MRT_station), [Bayfront](/wiki/Bayfront_MRT_station) and [Gardens by the Bay](/wiki/Gardens_by_the_Bay_MRT_station). [Marina Bay](/wiki/Marina_Bay_MRT_station) and [Bayfront](/wiki/Bayfront_MRT_station) are part of the [Circle Line Extension](/wiki/Circle_Line_(Singapore)) and serves [Marina Bay Sands](/wiki/Marina_Bay_Sands) integrated resort. The [Marina Coastal Expressway](/wiki/Marina_Coastal_Expressway) (MCE) serves the area. [Marina South](/wiki/Marina_South_MRT_station) MRT station on the [Thomson–East Coast MRT line](/wiki/Thomson%E2%80%93East_Coast_Line) will serve Marina South in the future, with the former opening in tandem with developments near it.\n",
