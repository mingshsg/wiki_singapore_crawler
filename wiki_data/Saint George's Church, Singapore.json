Constructed between 1910 and 1913, the church was built for the [British troops](/wiki/British_Armed_Forces) stationed in Tanglin Barracks which was once the General Headquarters of the [British Far East Land Forces](/wiki/British_Far_East_Command). The church's community comprises members from [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) and many other countries. They are bound by a common desire to follow [Jesus Christ](/wiki/Jesus_Christ), and to seek [God](/wiki/God)’s purpose for their lives. ## Leadership St. George's Church is a parish of the [Anglican Diocese of Singapore](/wiki/Anglican_Diocese_of_Singapore). The present [vicar](/wiki/Vicar_(Anglicanism)) is Revd. Dr Jonathan Wong. He is supported by Revd. Paul Tan (Auxiliary Priest). The previous [vicars](/wiki/Vicar_(Anglicanism)) of the church include Revd. Canon Lewis Lew, Revd. Ian Hadfield, Revd. Mark Roland Dickens, Revd. Canon Philip Sinden, Revd.

Bob Robinson. ## History **Origins of the Church building – Serving the British military in Singapore** St. George's Church was constructed from materials imported from [England](/wiki/England) and cost [£](/wiki/Pound_(currency))2,000 to build. The land was formerly used as a [nutmeg](/wiki/Nutmeg) [plantation](/wiki/Plantation) and it included Mount Harriet, a 103-foot high hill on which the church now stands. The land belonged to William E. Willan and was sold in 1865. However, even before the church was built, an [ordained](/wiki/Ordination) [minister](/wiki/Minister_of_religion) for the garrison was appointed in 1871. The current building dates back to 1910 but there was an earlier St. George's built in 1884 near the site of the present church. Both churches were built for the [British troops](/wiki/British_Armed_Forces) quartered at Tanglin Barracks which was once the General Headquarters of the [British Far East Land Forces](/wiki/British_Far_East_Command). After the [British forces](/wiki/British_Armed_Forces) withdrew from [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) in 1968, the place was used by Singapore's [Ministry of Defence](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Singapore)) as its headquarters before it moved to its new premises in [Bukit Gombak](/wiki/Bukit_Gombak) **From Military to Civilian Church** St. George's became a civilian church after the [British troops](/wiki/British_Armed_Forces) left [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) in 1971. It was [gazetted](/wiki/Gazette) a [national monument](/wiki/National_Monuments_of_Singapore) by the [National Heritage Board of Singapore](/wiki/National_Heritage_Board_(Singapore)) on 10 November 1978, and now serves a multinational Christian congregation in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). **Major Ivan Lyon Memorial** On the outside of the church is a memorial tablet to Major [Ivan Lyon](/wiki/Ivan_Lyon) D.S.O. M.B.E., who was killed on his second commando raid on military shipping in the Singapore Harbour in October 1944. At the time of the raid, [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) was more than 1,000 miles inside Imperial Japanese-held territory. ## Services There are three regular services conducted on Sundays and one on Wednesdays.
