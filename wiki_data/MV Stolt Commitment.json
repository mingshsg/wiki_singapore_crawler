  "content": "Chemical tanker involved in a 2015 collision **MV *Stolt Commitment*** is a [chemical tanker](/wiki/Chemical_tanker) owned by [Stolt Tankers](/wiki/Stolt-Nielsen) that collided with, and subsequently sank, the general cargo ship *[Thorco Cloud](/wiki/MV_Thorco_Cloud)* in the [Singapore Strait](/wiki/Singapore_Strait) in December 2015. The collision resulted in six casualties from a total crew of 12 on the *Thorco Cloud*, and minor structural damage to the *Stolt Commitment*. ## Construction The ship was constructed by [Kværner Florø AS](/wiki/STX_Europe), Norway. The keel was laid in January 1999 and the ship was launched in January 2000 as the MV *Bow Century*. ## History The ship has undergone name and flag state changes throughout its service life, including: - MV *Stolt Commitment* flagged in the [Cayman Islands](/wiki/Cayman_Islands) - MV *Bow Century* flagged in Norway. ### Collision with the *Thorco Cloud* On 16 December 2015 the ship was transiting the Singapore Strait en route to [Kaohsiung](/wiki/Kaohsiung) from [Rotterdam](/wiki/Rotterdam). During *Thorco Cloud*'s transit into the Singapore Strait traffic separation scheme after departing the Indonesian port of Batu Ampar, the two ships collided, causing the *Thorco Cloud* to be split into two parts and causing them both to sink within the strait. The *Stolt Commitment* only suffered minor structural damage. This article about transport in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) is a stub.
