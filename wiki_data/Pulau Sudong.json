  "content": "Subzone of Western Islands Planning Area in Singapore **Pulau Sudong** (Malay for **Sudong Island**) is a 209 hectares (520 acres) [coral](/wiki/Coral) [island](/wiki/Island) off the southern coast of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It was enlarged through a [land reclamation](/wiki/Land_reclamation) process during the late 1970s, and is home to the [Pulau Sudong Airport](/wiki/Pulau_Sudong_Airport). ## Restricted area Since the early 1980s, Pulau Sudong, together with [Pulau Senang](/wiki/Pulau_Senang) and [Pulau Pawai](/wiki/Pulau_Pawai), have formed the [Singapore Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces) southern islands [military](/wiki/Military) training area and live-firing zone. As with all other military installations in Singapore, the entire live-firing zone is strictly off limits to all civilians at all times of the day and night. The only exceptions to this are for workers who are contracted by [MINDEF](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Singapore)) to perform maintenance on the island's area calibration facilities. The island's [airport](/wiki/Pulau_Sudong_Airport) and [dock](/wiki/Dock_(maritime)) are maintained by the Singapore Armed Forces ([SAF](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces)), with most areas covered by dense vegetation - the island is a wildlife haven for migratory birds and plants alike. The airstrip is only utilised for emergencies that involve military aircraft. ## Etymology and history ***Sudong*** comes from the same root word as *tudong* in [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language), a [cone](/wiki/Cone_(geometry))-shaped food cover made from [matting](/wiki/Matting), which is also used as head covering by [padi](/wiki/Rice) planters. The [government](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore) [malaria](/wiki/Malaria) research station was formerly located on the island for a period in the 1940s. Prior to the airstrip being built, it was home to around 400 permanent inhabitants that lived in [kampongs](/wiki/Kampong). In 2015, the former island inhabitants petitioned to be allowed back to the island for a day to fulfill their dying wish. However, their request was denied. ## Sources - Victor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2004), *Toponymics - A Study of Singapore Street Names*, Eastern University Press, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-210-364-3 - Satellite image of Pulau Sudong - [Google Maps](/wiki/Google_Maps) This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
