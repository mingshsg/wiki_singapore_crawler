  "content": "Indonesian and Malay fried chicken dish ***Ayam goreng*** is an [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine) and [Malay](/wiki/Malay_cuisine) dish consisting of [deep-fried](/wiki/Deep_fried) [chicken](/wiki/Chicken_(food)) in [oil](/wiki/Cooking_oil). *Ayam goreng* literally means \"[fried chicken](/wiki/Fried_chicken)\" in [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_language), [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language), and also in many [Indonesian regional languages](/wiki/Languages_of_Indonesia) (e.g. [Javanese](/wiki/Javanese_language)). Unlike other countries, Indonesian fried chicken usually uses [turmeric](/wiki/Turmeric) and [garlic](/wiki/Garlic) as its main ingredients rather than flour. In 2024, [TasteAtlas](/wiki/TasteAtlas) ranked *ayam goreng* as one of the best fried chicken dishes and the best traditional chicken dishes in the world. ## Marination and spices Some versions of *ayam goreng* are neither coated in [batter](/wiki/Batter_(cooking)) nor flour, but seasoned richly with various [spices](/wiki/Spices). The spice mixture may vary among regions, but it usually consists of a combination of ground [shallot](/wiki/Shallot), garlic, [Indian bay leaves](/wiki/Indian_bay_leaves), [turmeric](/wiki/Turmeric), [lemongrass](/wiki/Lemongrass), [tamarind](/wiki/Tamarind) juice, [candlenut](/wiki/Candlenut), [galangal](/wiki/Galangal), salt, and sugar. The chicken pieces are soaked and marinated in the spice mixture for some time prior to frying, allowing the chicken to absorb the spices. The marination process might include heating the chicken in ground spices to assist the spice absorption. Most often prior to deep frying, *ayam goreng* is already half-cooked with yellowish colour tinted of turmeric. In Javanese, this process is called *ungkep*. The chicken is then [deep fried](/wiki/Deep_fried) in an ample amount of hot cooking oil, either [palm](/wiki/Palm_oil) or [coconut oil](/wiki/Coconut_oil). The chicken is well-fried until golden yellow. Some variants such as Javanese *ayam goreng kremes* might add the deep fried spiced flour as crispy granules. While in other recipes, these tasty granules are acquired from fried grated galangal or coconut (*[serundeng](/wiki/Serundeng)*). *Ayam goreng* is usually served with [steamed rice](/wiki/Steamed_rice), *[sambal](/wiki/Sambal) terasi* (chili with [shrimp paste](/wiki/Shrimp_paste)) or *sambal kecap* (sliced chilli and shallot in sweet soy sauce) as a dipping sauce or condiment and slices of [cucumber](/wiki/Cucumber) and tomato for garnish. Fried [tempeh](/wiki/Tempeh) and [tofu](/wiki/Tofu) might be added as side dishes. ## Variants There are many recipes of *ayam goreng*, among the popular ones are: - *Ayam goreng lengkuas*: [galangal](/wiki/Galangal) fried chicken. also known as *hayam goreng Bandung*: [Sundanese](/wiki/Sundanese_cuisine) [Bandung](/wiki/Bandung) style *ayam goreng*. - *Ayam goreng Padang*: [Padang](/wiki/Padang_food) style *ayam goreng*, there are several variants of Padang fried chicken.
