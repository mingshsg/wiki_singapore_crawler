Located between the [People's Park Complex](/wiki/People%27s_Park_Complex) and [Yue Hwa Building](/wiki/Yue_Hwa_Building), it was known as **Majestic Theatre**, which was a [Cantonese opera](/wiki/Cantonese_opera) house. ## History ### Early history In 1927, [Eu Tong Sen](/wiki/Eu_Tong_Sen), a [tin](/wiki/Tin) mining and rubber [magnate](/wiki/Magnate), built a Cantonese opera house for his wife who was a Cantonese opera fan. The theatre was Initially known as **Tien Yien Moh Toi Theatre** (天演舞台). Eu also formed an opera troupe for her, and bought the street on which the theatre sat, naming it Eu Tong Sen Street. The building was designed by [Swan and Maclaren](/wiki/Swan_and_Maclaren), the leading [architectural](/wiki/Architecture) firm at that time which also designed [Raffles Hotel](/wiki/Raffles_Hotel) and [Victoria Memorial Hall](/wiki/Victoria_Memorial_Hall). The theatre was completed in 1928. The theatre was a venue for Cantonese opera until 1938, when it was converted into a cinema. The [Shaw Brothers](/wiki/Shaw_Organisation) rented the place, renamed it the Queen's Theatre, and used it to screen the latest Cantonese [blockbuster](/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)) films. During the [Japanese occupation of Singapore](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore) in [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II), the theatre was renamed Tai Hwa Opera House when the [Imperial Japanese Army](/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army) took control of it. It was used to screen Japanese [propaganda films](/wiki/Propaganda_film). ### Post-war years Shortly after the Japanese occupation ended in 1945, the Shaw Brothers' [lease](/wiki/Lease) over the theatre also ended in September the same year. It was then [tenanted](/wiki/Leasehold_estate) to The Majestic Film Company, which gave the theatre its current name. In 1956, [Dato](/wiki/Malay_titles#Dato') [Loke Wan Tho](/wiki/Loke_Wan_Tho) of [Cathay Organisation](/wiki/Cathay_Organisation) with two partners, Wong Siew Leng and Teo Cheng Hay, bought the Majestic Theatre for [S$](/wiki/S$)1.1 million from the Eu family. During the 1950s and 1960s, the theatre was not only popular among the locals but also attracted film stars from Hong Kong such as [Grace Chang](/wiki/Grace_Chang) and [Lin Dai](/wiki/Lin_Dai). In 1983, the Cathay Organisation became the sole [owner](/wiki/Owner) after they bought out the partnership. The theatre continued screening [Chinese films](/wiki/Chinese_film) until 1998 when it was closed. ### Redevelopment In the early 2000s, the Majestic Theatre was [renovated](/wiki/Renovate) at a cost of S$8 million into a three-story shopping mall. The [conservation](/wiki/Architectural_conservation) building was then renamed *The Majestic*, and was opened on 17 January 2003.
