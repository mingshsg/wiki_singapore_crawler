Tamil is one of the longest-surviving languages, with over two thousand years of [written history](/wiki/Tamil_literature), dating back to the [Sangam period](/wiki/Sangam_period) (between 300 BCE and 300 CE). Tamils constitute about 5.7% of the Indian population and form the majority in the [South Indian](/wiki/South_India) state of [Tamil Nadu](/wiki/Tamil_Nadu) and the [union territory](/wiki/Union_territory) of [Puducherry](/wiki/Puducherry_(union_territory)). They also form significant proportions of the populations in [Sri Lanka](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils) (15.3%), [Malaysia](/wiki/Tamil_Malaysians) (7%) and [Singapore](/wiki/Indian_Singaporeans) (5%). Tamils have migrated world-wide since the 19th century CE and a significant population exists in [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa), [Mauritius](/wiki/Mauritius), [Fiji](/wiki/Fiji), as well as other regions such as the [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia), [Middle East](/wiki/Middle_East), [Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean) and parts of the [Western World](/wiki/Western_World). [Archaeological evidence](/wiki/Archaeological_evidence) from Tamil Nadu indicates a continuous history of human occupation for more than 3,800 years. In the Sangam period, [Tamilakam](/wiki/Tamilakam) was ruled by the [Three Crowned Kings](/wiki/Three_Crowned_Kings) of the [Cheras](/wiki/Chera_dynasty), [Cholas](/wiki/Chola_dynasty) and [Pandyas](/wiki/Pandya_dynasty). Smaller [Velir](/wiki/Velir) kings and chieftains ruled certain territories and maintained relationship with the larger kingdoms. Urbanisation and mercantile activity developed along the coasts during the later Sangam period with the Tamils [influencing](/wiki/History_of_Indian_influence_on_Southeast_Asia) the regional trade in the Indian Ocean region. Artifacts obtained from excavations indicate the presence of early [trade relations with the Romans](/wiki/Indo-Roman_trade_relations). The major kingdoms to rule the region later were the [Pallavas](/wiki/Pallava_dynasty) (3rd–9th century CE), and the [Vijayanagara Empire](/wiki/Vijayanagara_Empire) (14th–17th century CE). The island of Sri Lanka often saw attacks from the Indian mainland with the Cholas establishing their influence across the island and across several areas in Southeast Asia in the 10th century CE. This led to the spread of Tamil influence and contributed to the [cultural Indianisation](/wiki/Greater_India) of the region. Scripts brought by Tamil traders like the [Grantha](/wiki/Grantha_script) and [Pallava scripts](/wiki/Pallava_script), induced the development of many Southeast Asian scripts. The [Jaffna Kingdom](/wiki/Jaffna_Kingdom) later controlled the Tamil territory in the north of the Sri Lanka from 13th to 17th century CE. European colonization began in the 17th century CE, and continued for two centuries until the middle of the 20th century. Due to its long history, the Tamil culture has seen multiple influences over the years and have developed diversely. The Tamil visual art consists of a distinct [style of architecture](/wiki/Dravidian_architecture), sculpture and other art forms. Tamil sculpture ranges from stone sculptures in temples, to detailed [bronze icons](/wiki/Chola_art). The ancient Tamil country had its own system of music called [Tamil Pannisai](/wiki/Ancient_Tamil_music). Tamil performing arts include the theatre form [Koothu](/wiki/Koothu), [puppetry](/wiki/Puppetry) [Bommalattam](/wiki/Bommalattam), [classical dance](/wiki/Indian_classical_dance) [Bharatanatyam](/wiki/Bharatanatyam), and various [other traditional dance forms](/wiki/Dance_forms_of_Tamil_Nadu). [Hinduism](/wiki/Hinduism) is the major religion followed by the Tamils and the religious practices include the veneration of various [village deities](/wiki/Village_deities_of_South_India) and [ancient Tamil gods](/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Tamil_country). A smaller number are also [Christians](/wiki/Tamil_Christians) and [Muslims](/wiki/Tamil_Muslim), and a small percentage follow [Jainism](/wiki/Tamil_Jain) and [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism_amongst_Tamils). [Tamil cuisine](/wiki/Tamil_cuisine) consist of various [vegetarian](/wiki/Vegetarian_cuisine) and [meat](/wiki/Meat) items, usually spiced with [locally available spices](/wiki/Indian_spices). Historian [Michael Wood](/wiki/Michael_Wood_(historian)) called the Tamils the last surviving classical civilization on Earth, because the Tamils have preserved substantial elements of their past regarding belief, culture, music, and literature despite the influence of [globalization](/wiki/Globalization). ## Etymology *Tamil* is derived from the name of the [language](/wiki/Tamil_language). The people are referred to as *Tamiḻar* in Tamil language, which is etymologically linked to the name of the language. The [origin](/wiki/Tamil_language#Etymology) and precise etymology of the word Tamil is unclear with multiple theories attested to it. [Kamil Zvelebil](/wiki/Kamil_Zvelebil) suggests that the term *tamiz* might have been derived from *tam* meaning \"self\" and \"-iz\" having the connotation of \"unfolding sound\". Alternatively, he suggests a derivation of *tamiz* < *tam-iz* < **tav-iz* < **tak-iz*, meaning \"the proper process (of speaking)\". [Franklin Southworth](/wiki/Franklin_Southworth) suggests that the name comes from *tam-miz* > *tam-iz* meaning \"self-speak\", or \"our own speech\". It is unknown whether the term *Tamila* and its equivalents in [Prakrit](/wiki/Prakrit) such as *Damela*, *Damila*, or *Tamira* was first used as a self designation or by outsiders. The [Hathigumpha inscription](/wiki/Hathigumpha_inscription) from [Udayagiri](/wiki/Udayagiri_and_Khandagiri_Caves) in [Eastern India](/wiki/Eastern_India) dated to the second century BCE, describes a *T[r]amira samghata* (Confederacy of Tamil rulers), which was in existence for the previous 113 years. Epigraphical evidence from the second century BCE mentioning *Damela* or *Dameda* from [ancient Sri Lanka](/wiki/History_of_Sri_Lanka#Anuradhapura_period_(377_BCE–1017)) have been found. In the [Buddhist](/wiki/Buddhist_texts) [Jataka](/wiki/Jataka) texts, there is a mention of a *Damila-rattha* (Tamil dynasty). [Greek](/wiki/Hellenistic_Greece) historian [Strabo](/wiki/Strabo) (first century BCE) mentions that the [Roman Emperor](/wiki/Roman_Emperor) [Augustus](/wiki/Augustus) received an ambassador from *Pandyan of Dramira*. An inscription from [Amaravati](/wiki/Amaravathi_village,_Guntur_district) dated to third century CE refers to a *Dhamila-vaniya* (Tamil trader). ## History ### In India #### Pre-historic period (before 4th century BCE) [Archaeological evidence](/wiki/Archaeological_evidence) suggests the region was first inhabited by hominids over 400 millennia ago. Artifacts recovered in [Adichanallur](/wiki/Adichanallur) by the [Archaeological Survey of India](/wiki/Archaeological_Survey_of_India) (ASI) indicate [megalithic](/wiki/Megalith) urn burials, dating from back to 1500 BCE. which are also described in early Tamil literature. Excavations at [Keezhadi](/wiki/Keezhadi_excavation_site) have revealed a large urban settlement, with the earliest artefact dated to 580 BCE, during the time of urbanization in the [Indo-Gangetic plain](/wiki/Indo-Gangetic_plain). Epigraphical inscriptions found at Adichanallur and potsherds uncovered from Keezhadi use [Tamil Brahmi](/wiki/Tamil_Brahmi), a rudimentary script dated to 6th century BCE. #### Sangam period (3rd century BCE–3rd century CE) The [Sangam period](/wiki/Sangam_period) lasted from 3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE with the main source of history during the period coming from the various [Sangam literature](/wiki/Sangam_literature). Ancient [Tamilakam](/wiki/Tamilakam) was ruled by a [triumvirate](/wiki/Three_Crowned_Kings) of monarchical states, [Cheras](/wiki/Chera_dynasty), [Cholas](/wiki/Chola_dynasty) and [Pandyas](/wiki/Pandya_dynasty). These kings are referred to as *Vāṉpukaḻ Mūvar* (Three glorified by heaven) in the Sangam literature. The Cheras controlled the western part of Tamilkam, the Pandyas controlled the south, and the Cholas had their base in the [Kaveri](/wiki/Kaveri) delta. They are mentioned in the inscriptions from the [Mauryan Empire](/wiki/Mauryan_Empire) dated to third century BCE. [Kalinga](/wiki/Kalinga_(historical_kingdom)) inscriptions from the second century BCE refers to a confederacy of the Tamil kingdoms. The three kings called *Vendhar* ruled over several hill tribes headed by the *[Velir](/wiki/Velirs)* chiefs and settlements headed by clan chiefs called *Kizhar*. The rulers of smaller territories were referred to as *Kurunilamannar*, with *[Purananuru](/wiki/Purananuru)* mentioning the names of many such chieftains. The Sangam period rulers patronized multiple religions including [vedic religion](/wiki/Historical_Vedic_religion), [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism) and [Jainism](/wiki/Jainism) and sponsored some of the earliest Tamil literature with the oldest surviving work being [Tolkāppiyam](/wiki/Tolk%C4%81ppiyam), a book of Tamil grammar. *Purananuru* describes the public life and various unique cultural practices that existed during the period. The text talks about the [Vedic Sacrifices](/wiki/Yajna) performed by the kings as described in the [Vedas](/wiki/Vedas) and the rituals performed for the dead. Agriculture was an important occupation during the period, and there is evidence that networks of [irrigation](/wiki/Irrigation) channels were built as early as the 3rd century BCE. The Sangam literature describe fertile lands and people organised into various occupational groups. The governance of the land was through hereditary monarchies, although the sphere of the state's activities and the extent of the ruler's powers were limited through the adherence to an established order. The kingdoms had significant diplomatic and trade contacts with other kingdoms to the north and with the [Romans](/wiki/Ancient_Rome). [Roman coins](/wiki/Roman_currency) and other epigraphical evidence from South India and [potsherds](/wiki/Sherd) with Tamil writing found in excavations along the [Red Sea](/wiki/Red_Sea) indicate the presence of [Roman commerce](/wiki/Roman_commerce) with the ancient Tamilakam. Much of the commerce from the Romans and [Han China](/wiki/Han_dynasty) were facilitated via seaports including [Muziris](/wiki/Muziris) and [Korkai](/wiki/Korkai) with [spices](/wiki/Spices) being the most prized goods along with [pearls](/wiki/Pearls) and [silk](/wiki/Silk). There is evidence of emissaries sent to the Roman Emperor Augustus by the Pandya kings. An anonymous Greek traveler's account from first century CE, *[Periplus Maris Erytraei](/wiki/Periplus_Maris_Erytraei)*, describes the ports of the Pandya and Chera kingdoms in *[Damirica](/wiki/Damirica)* and their commercial activity in detail. It also describes that the chief exports of the ancient Tamils were [pepper](/wiki/Black_pepper), [malabathrum](/wiki/Malabathrum), [pearls](/wiki/Pearl), [ivory](/wiki/Ivory), silk, [spikenard](/wiki/Spikenard), [diamonds](/wiki/Diamonds), [sapphires](/wiki/Sapphire), and [tortoiseshell](/wiki/Tortoiseshell_material). #### Medieval era (4th–13th century CE) From the fourth century CE, the region was ruled by the [Kalabhras](/wiki/Kalabhra_dynasty), warriors belonging to the [Vellalar](/wiki/Vellalar) community, who were once feudatories of the three ancient Tamil kingdoms. The Kalabhra era is referred to as the \"dark period\" of Tamil history, and information about it is generally inferred from any mentions in the literature and inscriptions that are dated many centuries after their era ended. Around the seventh century CE, the Kalabhras were overthrown by the Pandyas and Cholas. Though they existed previously, the period saw the rise of the [Pallavas](/wiki/Pallava_dynasty) in the sixth century CE under [Mahendravarman I](/wiki/Mahendravarman_I), who ruled parts of [South India](/wiki/South_India) with [Kanchipuram](/wiki/Kanchipuram) as their capital. The Pallavas were noted for their patronage of architecture. Throughout their reign, the Pallavas remained in constant conflict with the Cholas, the Pandyas and other kingdoms of [Chalukyas of Badami](/wiki/Chalukya_dynasty) and the [Rashtrakutas](/wiki/Rashtrakutas). The Pandyas were revived by [Kadungon](/wiki/Kadungon) towards the end of the sixth century CE and with the Cholas in obscurity in [Uraiyur](/wiki/Uraiyur), the Tamil country was divided between the Pallavas and the Pandyas. The area west of the [Western Ghats](/wiki/Western_Ghats) became increasingly distinct from the eastern parts. A new language [Malayalam](/wiki/Malayalam) evolved from Tamil in the region and the socio-cultural transformation was altered further by the migration of [Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit)-speaking [Indo-Aryans](/wiki/Indo-Aryan_peoples) from Northern India in the eighth century CE. The Cholas were revived in the ninth century CE by [Vijayalaya Chola](/wiki/Vijayalaya_Chola) and the last Pallavas ruler [Aparajitavarman](/wiki/Aparajitavarman) was defeated by the Chola prince [Aditya I](/wiki/Aditya_I). After the defeat of the Pallavas, the Cholas became the dominant kingdom with the capital at [Thanjavur](/wiki/Thanjavur). The Chola influence expanded subsequently with [Rajaraja I](/wiki/Rajaraja_I) conquering the entire Southern India and parts of present-day [Sri Lanka](/wiki/Sri_Lanka) and [Maldives](/wiki/Maldives), and increased Chola influence across the [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean) in the eleventh century CE. Rajaraja brought in administrative reforms including the reorganisation of Tamil country into individual administrative units. Under his son [Rajendra Chola I](/wiki/Rajendra_Chola_I), the Chola empire reached its zenith and stretched as far as [Bengal](/wiki/Bengal) in the north and across the Indian Ocean. He defeated the [Eastern Chalukyas](/wiki/Eastern_Chalukya) and the [Chola navy](/wiki/Chola_navy) [invaded](/wiki/Chola_invasion_of_Srivijaya) the [Srivijaya Empire](/wiki/Srivijaya) in South East Asia. The Cholas had trade links with the Chinese [Song Dynasty](/wiki/Song_Dynasty) and across Southeast Asia. The Cholas built many temples with the most notable being the [Brihadisvara Temple](/wiki/Brihadisvara_Temple,_Thanjavur) at Thanjavur. The latter half of the eleventh century saw the union of Chola and [Vengi](/wiki/Vengi) kingdoms under [Kulottunga I](/wiki/Kulottunga_I). The Cholas repulsed attacks from the [Western Chalukyas](/wiki/Western_Chalukyas) and maintained its influence over the various kingdoms of Southeast Asia. According to historian [Nilakanta Sastri](/wiki/Nilakanta_Sastri), Kulottunga avoided unnecessary wars and had a long and prosperous reign characterized by unparalleled success that laid the foundations of the empire for the next 150 years. The eventual decline of Chola power began towards the end of [Kulottunga III](/wiki/Kulottunga_III)'s reign in the thirteenth century CE. The Pandyas again reigned supreme under [Maravarman Sundara I](/wiki/Maravarman_Sundara_Pandyan) and defeated the Cholas under [Rajaraja III](/wiki/Rajaraja_III). Though the Cholas were revived briefly with the aid of [Hoysalas](/wiki/Hoysalas), civil war between Rajaraja and [Rajendra III](/wiki/Rajendra_III) weakened them further. With the Hoysalas later siding with the Pandyas, the Pandyas consolidated control over the region. The Pandya empire reached its zenith in the thirteenth century CE under [Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I](/wiki/Jatavarman_Sundara_Pandyan_I) after he defeated the Hoysalas, the [Kakatiyas](/wiki/Kakatiyas) and captured parts of Sri Lanka. The Pandyas ruled from their capital of [Madurai](/wiki/Madurai) and expanded trade links with other maritime empires. [Venetian](/wiki/Republic_of_Venice) explorer [Marco Polo](/wiki/Marco_Polo) mentioned the Pandyas as the richest empire in existence. The Pandyas also built a number of temples including the [Meenakshi Amman Temple](/wiki/Meenakshi_Amman_Temple) at Madurai. In the fourteenth century CE, the Pandyan empire was engulfed in a civil war and also faced repeated invasions by the [Delhi Sultanate](/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate). In 1335, the Pandyan capital was conquered by [Jalaluddin Ahsan Khan](/wiki/Jalaluddin_Ahsan_Khan) and the short-lived [Madurai Sultanate](/wiki/Madurai_Sultanate) was established. #### Vijayanagar and Nayak period (14th–17th century CE) The [Vijayanagara kingdom](/wiki/Vijayanagara_empire) was founded in 1336 CE. The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries. In the sixteenth century, Vijaynagara king [Krishnadeva Raya](/wiki/Krishnadeva_Raya) was forced to intervene in the conflict between their vassals, the Cholas and the Pandyas. The [Nayak](/wiki/Nayak_dynasty) governor under Raya briefly took control of Madurai before it was restored to the empire. The Vijayanagara empire was defeated in the [Battle of Talikota](/wiki/Battle_of_Talikota) in 1565 by a confederacy of [Deccan sultanates](/wiki/Deccan_sultanates). The Nayaks, who were the military governors in the Vijaynagara empire, took control of the region amongst whom the [Nayaks of Madurai](/wiki/Nayaks_of_Madurai) and [Nayaks of Thanjavur](/wiki/Nayaks_of_Thanjavur) were the most prominent. They introduced the [palayakkararar](/wiki/Polygar) system and re-constructed some of the temples in Tamil Nadu including the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. #### Later conflicts and European colonization (17th to 20th century CE) In the 18th century, the [Mughal Empire](/wiki/Mughal_Empire) administered the region through the [Nawab of the Carnatic](/wiki/Nawab_of_the_Carnatic) with his seat at [Arcot](/wiki/Arcot), who defeated the Madurai Nayaks. The [Marathas](/wiki/Maratha_kingdom) [attacked](/wiki/Siege_of_Trichinopoly_(1741)) several times and defeated the Nawab after the [Siege of Trichinopoly (1751-1752)](/wiki/Siege_of_Trichinopoly_(1751-1752)). This led to a short-lived [Thanjavur Maratha kingdom](/wiki/Thanjavur_Maratha_kingdom). Europeans started to establish trade centres from the 16th century along the eastern coast. The [Portuguese](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Portugal) arrived in 1522 followed by the [Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_people) and the [Danes](/wiki/Danes). In 1639, the [British East India Company](/wiki/British_East_India_Company) obtained a grant for land from the Vijayanager emperor and the [French](/wiki/French_people) established trading posts at [Pondichéry](/wiki/Puducherry_(city)) in 1693. After several conflicts between the British and the French, the British established themselves as the major power in the eighteenth century CE. The British regained control of Madras in 1749 through the [Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle](/wiki/Treaty_of_Aix-la-Chapelle_(1748)) and resisted a [French siege attempt](/wiki/Siege_of_Madras) in 1759. The British East India Company demanded tax collection rights, which led to constant conflicts with the local [Palaiyakkarars](/wiki/Polygar) and resulted in the [Polygar Wars](/wiki/Polygar_Wars). [Puli Thevar](/wiki/Puli_Thevar) was one of the earliest opponents, joined later by [Rani Velu Nachiyar](/wiki/Rani_Velu_Nachiyar) and [Kattabomman](/wiki/Kattabomman) in the first series of Polygar wars. The [Maruthu brothers](/wiki/Maruthu_brothers) along with [Oomaithurai](/wiki/Oomaithurai), formed a coalition with [Dheeran Chinnamalai](/wiki/Dheeran_Chinnamalai) and Kerala Varma [Pazhassi Raja](/wiki/Pazhassi_Raja), which fought the British in the Second Polygar War. In the later 18th century, the [Mysore kingdom](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Mysore) captured parts of the region and engaged in constant fighting with the British which culminated in the four [Anglo-Mysore Wars](/wiki/Anglo-Mysore_War). By the late eighteenth century CE, the British had conquered most of the region and established the [Madras Presidency](/wiki/Madras_Presidency) with Madras as the capital. On 10 July 1806, the [Vellore mutiny](/wiki/Vellore_mutiny), which was the first instance of a large-scale mutiny by Indian sepoys against the British East India Company, took place in [Vellore Fort](/wiki/Vellore_Fort). After the [Indian Rebellion of 1857](/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857), the [British Parliament](/wiki/British_Parliament) passed the [Government of India Act 1858](/wiki/Government_of_India_Act_1858), which transferred the governance of India from the East India Company to the British crown, forming the [British Raj](/wiki/British_Raj). Failure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the [Ryotwari](/wiki/Ryotwari) system resulted in two severe famines in the Madras Presidency, the [Great Famine of 1876–78](/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1876%E2%80%9378) and the [Indian famine of 1896–97](/wiki/Indian_famine_of_1896%E2%80%9397) which killed millions and the migration of many Tamils as bonded laborers to other British countries eventually forming the present [Tamil diaspora](/wiki/Tamil_diaspora). The [Indian Independence movement](/wiki/Indian_Independence_movement) gathered momentum in the early 20th century with the formation of the [Indian National Congress](/wiki/Indian_National_Congress), which was based on an idea propagated by the members of the [Theosophical Society](/wiki/Theosophical_Society) movement after a Theosophical convention held in Madras in December 1884. Various Tamils were contributors to the Independence movement including [V. O. Chidambaram Pillai](/wiki/V._O._Chidambaram_Pillai), [Subramaniya Siva](/wiki/Subramaniya_Siva) and [Bharatiyar](/wiki/Subramania_Bharati). The Tamils formed a significant percentage of the members of the [Indian National Army](/wiki/Indian_National_Army) (INA), founded by [Subhas Chandra Bose](/wiki/Subhas_Chandra_Bose). #### Post Indian Independence (1947–present) After the [Independence of India](/wiki/Independence_of_India) in 1947, the Madras Presidency became [Madras state](/wiki/Madras_State), comprising present-day Tamil Nadu and parts of [Andhra Pradesh](/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh), [Karnataka](/wiki/Karnataka) and [Kerala](/wiki/Kerala). The state was further re-organised as a state for Tamils when the boundaries were redrawn linguistically in (/wiki/States_Reorganisation_Act,_1956) into the current shape. On 14 January 1969, Madras state was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning \"Tamil country\". In 1965, Tamils [agitated](/wiki/Anti-Hindi_agitations) against the [imposition of Hindi](/wiki/Imposition_of_Hindi) and in support of continuing English as a medium of communication which eventually led to English being retained as an official language of India alongside Hindi. After experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after Indian independence, the [Human Development Index](/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_and_union_territories_by_Human_Development_Index) of the Tamils have consistently improved due to [reform-oriented](/wiki/Economic_reforms_in_India) economic policies and in the 2000s, the region has become one of the most urbanized states in the country. ### In Sri Lanka #### Pre-Anuradhapura period (before fifth century CE) There are various theories from scholars over the presence of Tamil people in Sri Lanka. Historian [K. Indrapala](/wiki/K._Indrapala) states that Tamil replaced a previous language of an indigenous mesolithic population, who later became the Eelam Tamils and the cultural diffusion happened well before the arrival of [Sinhalese people](/wiki/Sinhalese_people) in Sri Lanka. Eelam Tamils consider themselves lineal descendants of the aboriginal [Naga](/wiki/Naga_people_of_Sri_Lanka) and [Yaksha](/wiki/Yaksha) people of Sri Lanka. A [cobra](/wiki/Indian_Cobra) totem known as *Nakam* in the Tamil language is still part of the Tamil tradition in Sri Lanka. Remains of settlements and megalithic burial sites of people culturally similar to those of present-day Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu in modern India have been excavated at Pomparippu on the west coast and in [Kathiraveli](/wiki/Kathiraveli) on the east coast of the island. These epigraphical evidence have been dated to a period between fifth century BCE and second century CE. Cultural similarities in burial practices in South India and Sri Lanka were dated by archeologists to the beginning of the [Iron Age](/wiki/Iron_Age) in the region around twelfth century BCE. There were specific migration routes that extended from South India to the island. These people moved further to the South of the island, and intermingled with the existent people. #### Anuradhapura period (4th century BCE to 10th century CE) [Black and red ware](/wiki/Black_and_red_ware_culture) potsherds found in Sri Lanka from the early reign of [Anuradhapura kingdom](/wiki/Anuradhapura_kingdom), indicate a similar cultural connection with the people of South India. The [Tamil Brahmi](/wiki/Tamil_Brahmi) inscriptions on them indicate Tamil clan names such as *Parumakal*, *Ay*, *Vel*, *Utiyan*, *Ticaiyan*, *Cuda* and *Naka*, which points to the presence of Tamils in the region. Excavations in [Poonakari](/wiki/Poonakari) in the north of the island have yielded several inscriptions including the mention of *vela*, a name related to *velirs* of the ancient Tamil country. Epigraphical evidence of people identified as Damelas (the Prakrit word for Tamil people) from the second century CE have been found in [Anuradhapura](/wiki/Anuradhapura), the capital city of the northern [Rajarata](/wiki/Rajarata) region. Historical records mention that the three Tamil kingdoms were involved in the island's affairs from second century BCE. Chola king [Ellalan](/wiki/Ellalan) captured the Anuradhapura Kingdom from 205 BCE to 161 BCE. Tamil soldiers from Tamilakam came to Anuradhapura in large numbers in the seventh century CE with the local chiefs and kings relying on them. In the eighth century CE, various Tamil villages collectively known as *Demel-kaballa* (Tamil allotment), *Demelat-valademin* (Tamil villages), and *Demel-gam-bim* (Tamil villages and lands) were established. In the ninth and tenth centuries CE, Pandya and Chola incursions started in the island which culminated with the Chola annexation of the island. #### Polonnaruwa and Jaffna kingdom (11th–15th century CE) The Chola influence lasted until the latter half of the eleventh century CE and the Chola decline was followed by the restoration of the [Polonnaruwa monarchy](/wiki/Polonnaruwa). In 1215, following Pandya invasions, the Tamil-dominant [Aryacakravarti dynasty](/wiki/Aryacakravarti_dynasty) established the [Jaffna Kingdom](/wiki/Jaffna_Kingdom) on the [Jaffna](/wiki/Jaffna) peninsula and in parts of northern and upper eastern Sri Lanka. In the fourteenth century CE, the Aryacakaravarthi expansion into the south of the island was halted by [Alagakkonara](/wiki/Alagakkonara), who belonged to a feudal family from [Kanchipuram](/wiki/Kanchipuram) that migrated to Sri Lanka in the previous century and converted to Buddhism. He served as the chief minister of the Sinhalese king [Parakramabahu V](/wiki/Parakramabahu_V) (1344–59 CE) and his descendant Vira Alakeshwara briefly became the king later before the [Ming](/wiki/Ming_Dynasty) admiral [Zheng He](/wiki/Zheng_He) overthrew him in 1409 CE after which the influence of his family declined. The [caste structure](/wiki/Caste_system_in_Sri_Lanka) of the Sinhalese also accommodated Hindu immigrants from South India, which led to the emergence of new Sinhalese caste groups such as the *[Radala](/wiki/Radala)*, the *[Salagama](/wiki/Salagama)*, the *[Durava](/wiki/Durava)* and the *[Karava](/wiki/Karava)*. #### Later conflicts and European colonization (16th–20th century CE) The Aryachakaravarthi dynasty continued to rule over large parts of northeast Sri Lanka until arrival of the Europeans on the island in the sixteenth century CE. Portuguese traders reached Sri Lanka by 1505 CE and the Jaffna kingdom came to the attention of Portuguese due to its presence as a logistical and strategic base for accessing the interior ruled by the [Kandyan kingdom](/wiki/Kandyan_kingdom). King [Cankili I](/wiki/Sankili_Segarajasekaran) resisted contacts with the Portuguese and repelled [Parava](/wiki/Paravas) [Catholics](/wiki/Catholics) who were brought from India to the [Mannar Island](/wiki/Mannar_Island) to take over the lucrative pearl fisheries from the Jaffna kings. The wrested Mannar during the [first invasion](/wiki/Portuguese_invasion_of_Jaffna_kingdom_(1560)) in 1560 and killed king [Puvirasa Pandaram](/wiki/Puvirasa_Pandaram) during the [second expedition](/wiki/Portuguese_invasion_of_Jaffna_kingdom_(1591)) in 1591. After the conflicts, the Portuguese [secured](/wiki/Portuguese_conquest_of_the_Jaffna_kingdom) the kingdom in 1619 from the unpopular [Cankili II](/wiki/Cankili_II), who was helped by the Thanjavur Nayaks. English sailor [Robert Knox](/wiki/Robert_Knox_(sailor)) arrived in the island in 1669 and described the Tamil settlements in the *[An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon](/wiki/An_Historical_Relation_of_the_Island_Ceylon)* published in 1681. The [Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_Republic) captured the island later and ruled for more than a century. Following the [1795 invasion of the British](/wiki/Invasion_of_Ceylon_(1795)) and the [Kandyan Wars](/wiki/Kandyan_Wars), the island came to the control of the British in the early nineteenth century CE. Upon arrival in June 1799, [Hugh Cleghorn](/wiki/Hugh_Cleghorn_(colonial_administrator)), the island's first British colonial secretary, wrote to the British government: \"Two different nations from a very ancient period have divided between them the possession of the island. First the Sinhalese, inhabiting the interior in its Southern and Western parts, and secondly the Tamils who possess the Northern and Eastern districts. These two nations differ entirely in their religion, language, and manners.\" Irrespective of the ethnic differences, the British imposed a unitary state structure in [British Ceylon](/wiki/British_Ceylon) for better administration. During the British colonial rule, Tamils held higher positions in the government and were favoured by the British for their qualification in English education. In the northern highlands, the lands of the Sinhalese were seized by the British and [Indian Tamils](/wiki/Indian_Tamils_of_Sri_Lanka) were settled there as plantation workers. Tamils who migrated in the nineteenth century CE to work on tea plantations were later termed as the [Indian Tamils](/wiki/Indian_Tamils_of_Sri_Lanka). #### Post Sri Lankan independence (1948–present) Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948 and after the colonial rule ended, ethnic tension rose between the Sinhalese, who constituted a majority, and the Tamils. In 1956, the [Sinhala Only Act](/wiki/Sinhala_Only_Act) designated [Sinhala](/wiki/Sinhala_language) as the only official language of Sri Lanka, which forced many Tamils to resign as civil servants because they were not fluent in the language. The Tamils saw the act as linguistic, cultural and economic discrimination against them. Anti-Tamil [pogroms](/wiki/Pogrom) in (/wiki/1956_Ceylonese_riots) and (/wiki/1958_anti-Tamil_pogrom) resulted in deaths of many Tamils and further escalated the conflict. More than a million Indian Tamil plantation workers were made stateless after Sri Lanka refused citizenship to them. In 1964, the [Sri Lankan](/wiki/Government_of_Sri_Lanka) and [Indian governments](/wiki/Government_of_India) entered into an agreement, based on which, about 300,000 would be granted Sri Lankan citizenship and about 975,000 Tamils would be [repatriated](/wiki/Repatriate) to India over a period of fifteen years. A new [Constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Sri_Lanka) enacted in the 1970s further discriminated against the Tamils and various state-sponsored schemes led Sinhalese settlers into Tamil populated areas. The [1977 anti-Tamil pogrom](/wiki/1977_anti-Tamil_pogrom) was followed by a crackdown against the Tamils, which curtailed their rights. Following the declaration of state of emergency in 1981, state-backed Sinhalese mobs turned on Tamils, which led many Tamils to leave the country as refugees resulting in an exodus more than half a million to India and other countries. By the 1970s, initial non-violent political struggle for an [independent Tamil state](/wiki/Tamil_Eelam) in the [north](/wiki/Northern_Province,_Sri_Lanka) and [east](/wiki/North_Eastern_Province,_Sri_Lanka) of Sri Lanka, developed into a violent secessionist insurgency. This led to the bloody [Sri Lankan Civil War](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_civil_war) for more than three decades. The conflict resulted in the deaths of at least 100,000 Tamils in the island and led to the flight of over 800,000 refugees. The war ended after the [Sri Lankan military offensive](/wiki/2008%E2%80%932009_Sri_Lankan_Army_Northern_offensive) in 2009. Since the end of the civil war, the Sri Lankan state has been subject to much global criticism for violating [human rights](/wiki/Human_rights_in_Sri_Lanka) as a result of committing [war crimes](/wiki/War_crimes_during_the_final_stages_of_the_Sri_Lankan_civil_war) through bombing civilian targets, usage of heavy weaponry, the [abduction](/wiki/Enforced_disappearances_in_Sri_Lanka) and [massacres of Sri Lankan Tamils](/wiki/List_of_attacks_on_civilians_attributed_to_Sri_Lankan_government_forces) and [sexual violence](/wiki/Sexual_violence_against_Tamils_in_Sri_Lanka). ## Geographic distribution ### India As per the [2011 Census](/wiki/2011_Census_of_India), there were 69 million Tamil speakers, constituting about 5.7% of the Indian population. Tamils formed the majority in the [South Indian](/wiki/South_India) state of [Tamil Nadu](/wiki/Tamil_Nadu) (63.8 million) and the [union territory](/wiki/Union_territory) of [Puducherry](/wiki/Puducherry_(union_territory)) (1.1 million). There were also significant Tamil population in other states of India such as [Karnataka](/wiki/Karnataka) (2.1 million), [Andhra Pradesh](/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh) and [Telangana](/wiki/Telangana) (0.7 million), [Maharashtra](/wiki/Maharashtra) (0.5 million), and [Kerala](/wiki/Kerala) (0.5 million). ### Sri Lanka Tamils in Sri Lanka are classified into two ethnic groups by the [Sri Lankan government](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_government): [Sri Lankan Tamils](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils), also known as Eelam Tamils, and [Indian Origin Tamils](/wiki/Indian_Tamils_of_Sri_Lanka), who accounted for 11.2%, and 4.1% of the country's population, respectively, in 2011. The Sri Lankan Tamils (or Ceylon Tamils) are the descendants of the Tamils of the old Jaffna Kingdom and east coast chieftainships called [Vannimais](/wiki/Vannimai). The Indian Tamils (or Hill Country Tamils) are descendants of laborers who migrated from Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in the 19th century to work on tea plantations. Most Sri Lankan Tamils live in the Northern and Eastern provinces and around [Colombo](/wiki/Colombo), whereas most Indian Tamils live in the central highlands. Historically, both the Tamil ethnic groups have identified themselves as separate communities, although there has been a greater sense of unity since the 1980s. There also exists a significant [Tamil Muslim](/wiki/Tamil_Muslim) population in Sri Lanka. However, they are listed as a separate entity under the [Moors](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Moor) by the government. However, genealogical evidence suggests that most of the Sri Lankan Moor community are of Tamil ethnicity, and that the majority of their ancestors were also Tamils who had lived in the country for generations, and had converted to Islam from other faiths. ### Tamil diaspora\n",
