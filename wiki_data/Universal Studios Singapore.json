It features 24 [rides](/wiki/Theme_park#Rides_and_attractions), shows, and [attractions](/wiki/Theme_park#Rides_and_attractions) in seven themed zones. It is one of the five [Universal Studios theme parks](/wiki/Universal_Destinations_%26_Experiences) around the world. It was a key component of [Genting Singapore](/wiki/Genting_Singapore)'s bid for the right to build Singapore's second integrated resort (IR). On 8 December 2006, the Singapore government announced that the consortium had won the bid. Construction of the theme park and the rest of the resort started on 19 April 2007. It is the second [Universal Studios theme park](/wiki/Universal_Destinations_%26_Experiences) in Asia, the first being [Universal Studios Japan](/wiki/Universal_Studios_Japan) in Osaka, and the only one in [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia). Official plans for the park were first unveiled to the public when Universal Studios Singapore released a map of the entire park on 20 October 2009. Universal Studios Singapore attracted more than 2 million visitors in the 9 months from its opening. The park officially began operations on 28 May 2011. Over 3 million guests visited the park in its opening year. Since then, Universal Studios Singapore has had approximately 4 million visitors every year. Visitors are made up of local Singaporeans and international tourists. It has been marketed by [Universal Destinations & Experiences](/wiki/Universal_Destinations_%26_Experiences) as a \"one-of-its-kind theme park in Asia\" and that the park was the only one of its kind in Southeast Asia for the foreseeable future. According to the AECOM Theme Index Global Attraction Attendance Report, Universal Studios Singapore is one of the top visited amusement/theme parks worldwide. ## History ### Park history The construction of Resorts World Sentosa and Universal Studios Singapore began on 19 April 2008.
