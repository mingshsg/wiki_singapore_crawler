  "content": "Pro wrestling promotion in Singapore **Singapore Pro Wrestling**, commonly shortened to **SPW**, is a [professional wrestling](/wiki/Professional_wrestling) promotion based in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It was the first modern professional wrestling promotion in [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia), and was founded by [Andruew Tang](/wiki/Andruew_Tang) (known as \"The Statement\" Andruew Tang in SPW), the first Singaporean professional wrestler, and Vadim Koryagin, in February 2012. The promotion also has a wrestling school, in which Andruew Tang is the head coach, and SPW wrestlers, Aiden Rex, Dr. Gore, [Alexis Lee](/wiki/Alexis_Lee) and [Da Butcherman](/wiki/Da_Butcherman) work as assistant coaches. SPW is best known for producing [Dante Chen](/wiki/Dante_Chen) (known as \"Trexxus\" during his time in SPW), the first wrestler from Southeast Asia to sign with [WWE](/wiki/WWE), making his debut on [WWE NXT](/wiki/WWE_NXT), on 22 September 2021. ## History ### Early years (2011–2014) In 2011, Andruew Tang, an aspiring Singaporean professional wrestler, would attend a talk by Vadim Koryagin, a Russian businessman and owner of [Independent Wrestling Federation (IWF)](/wiki/Independent_Wrestling_Federation_(Russia)), a Russia-based promotion, established in 2002. Together the two would form the nation's first pro wrestling promotion, Singapore Pro Wrestling in February 2012. They would begin to train the first generation of Singaporean professional wrestlers, including Tang, who would become [\"The Statement\" Andruew Tang](/wiki/%22The_Statement%22_Andruew_Tang), Singapore's first professional wrestler and [Kaiser Trexxus](/wiki/Dante_Chen), who would become the first Singaporean in the WWE, through Vadim's coaching and expertise. SPW faced difficulties in the beginning, with many people doubting the promotion, and believing that Singaporeans \"were too small\". In the beginning some of their wrestlers would appear in IWF shows, but later on they would host live shows in Singapore, beginning to gain an audience. SPW would develop more regular talent, including Dr. Gore and The Eurasian Dragon, and eventually Tang and Trexxus would become trainers, after honing their talents. In 2014, SPW would grow to a size that they were able to host international talent including [Johnny Gargano](/wiki/Johnny_Gargano) and [Sonjay Dutt](/wiki/Sonjay_Dutt). ### Growth and expansion (2015–2019) A major turning point for SPW, was when they hosted a show a day before the 2015 [WWE Live](/wiki/WWE_Live) Event at the [Singapore Indoor Stadium](/wiki/Singapore_Indoor_Stadium), which sold out completely. SPW would inaugurate their first title, the Southeast Asian Championship in 2015, with their first champion being [\"The Statement\" Andruew Tang](/wiki/%22The_Statement%22_Andruew_Tang). SPW would host foreign talent, including [IWF](/wiki/Independent_Wrestling_Federation) wrestler, [Lokomotiv](/wiki/Ivan_Markov_(wrestler)) and [DDT](/wiki/DDT_Pro-Wrestling) wrestler, [Masa Takanashi](/wiki/Masa_Takanashi), who would help the promotion grow, each winning the Southeast Asian championship. In the next year SPW would add three more titles to the promotion, the Queen of Asia, Tag Team and Singapore championships. In 2017, [Rene Dupree](/wiki/Rene_Dupree) would debut in SPW, facing Tang. Later that year, [NXT UK](/wiki/NXT_UK) Champion, at that time, [Pete Dunne](/wiki/Pete_Dunne) would debut in the company and face Tang in a singles match. SPW would continue to grow, developing local talent such as Alexis Lee (who would be called for a WWE tryout along with The Statement and Kaiser Trexxus), bodybuilder and the 2016 Mr. Singapore, [Danie \"Destroyer\" Dharma](/wiki/Danie_Dharma), [Da Butcherman](/wiki/Da_Butcherman), Big T, BGJ and Aiden Rex, who would all win various championships in the SPW promotion. In 2018, SPW would host its first all female event, titled Ladies Night. The main event of this show would feature [Riho](/wiki/Riho) facing [Makoto](/wiki/Makoto_(wrestler)), which would become SPWs most viewed match ever. In 2019, globally-known [AEW](/wiki/AEW) wrestler, [Kenny Omega](/wiki/Kenny_Omega), would also debut in the promotion, participating in a 3 on 3 tag match. [Tajiri](/wiki/Yoshihiro_Tajiri) would make his SPW debut in 2019, defeating Tang. SPW would grow to have over 10,000 subscribers on YouTube, and over 10,000 followers on Instagram and Facebook combined. ### Covid-19 and return (2020–present) SPW hosted its last show of 2020, No Guts No Glory, in February, featuring then [NXT UK Women's Champion](/wiki/NXT_UK_Women%27s_Champion), [Meiko Satomura](/wiki/Meiko_Satomura) and [Dash Chisako](/wiki/Dash_Chisako) in the main event. During the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), SPW produced two seasons of an in-house show, called SPW Prove: Alive and Kicking and SPW Prove: It's A Slamdemic. During the first season of Prove, The Statement would retire [Kaiser Trexxus](/wiki/Dante_Chen) from the promotion, who would leave to [WWE NXT](/wiki/WWE_NXT) and debut as [Dante Chen](/wiki/Dante_Chen). Their second season was cut short as restrictions were lifted and SPW returned to a live show format, with their first private live show back on 15 April 2022, SPW: Sembawang Showdown, a private event for [migrant workers of Singapore.](/wiki/Migrant_workers_in_Singapore) SPW hosted their first public live show, SPW: Homecoming on 27 May 2022, that sold out in a few days. In July, SPW had their second public event of the year, SPW: Battlefront. In September, SPW would announce its partnership with *Nothing But Cheese Burger* to introduce the promotions 5th title, The NBCB Championship, a 24/7 championship. In November 2022, SPW hosted its 10th anniversary show, featuring the return of [Riho](/wiki/Riho), [Tajiri](/wiki/Yoshihiro_Tajiri), [Masa Takanashi](/wiki/Masa_Takanashi), [HoHo Lun](/wiki/Ho_Ho_Lun) and the debut of [Chris Brookes](/wiki/Chris_Brookes) and [Mei Suruga](/wiki/Mei_Suruga), SPW X: Astronomical Anniversary. ## Roster Ring nameReal nameNotesAiden Rex*Unknown*[Alexis Lee](/wiki/Alexis_Lee)Lee Xin YiSPW Queen of Asia ChampionBGJ*Unknown*SPW Southeast Asian Tag Team ChampionBlack ArrowKamalrajBryson Blade*Unknown*Carl HellaJoel Sam ThomasGeneral ManagerCBK*Unknown*SPW Southeast Asian Tag Team ChampionCK VinAlvin HoSPW Singapore Champion[Da Butcherman](/wiki/Da_Butcherman)Danial AliasDarren 'Yam Seng' ChuaDarren ChuaRing Announcer[Destroyer Dharma](/wiki/Danie_Dharma)Danie DharmaDr. GoreCaleb TanEmman*Unknown*Kentona*Unknown*Kyle \"The Trickster\" BlackKeeran Broysten\"Mad Kat\" Karina*Unknown*Mason*Unknown*Mighty MightyMohammed TaufikSelina*Unknown*Mr. Frois*Unknown*Ring AnnouncerRayRay LimReferee Pritish*Unknown*RefereeReferee Sodiq*Unknown*RefereeRiky Malek*Unknown*RizRizRJ*Unknown*Ryan Shen*Unknown*SPW Hardcore ChampionSayn RH*Unknown*[\"The Statement\" Andruew Tang](/wiki/%22The_Statement%22_Andruew_Tang)Andruew Tang You LiangCo-founder / Promoter ### Notable alumni/guests - Anton Deryabin - [Baliyan Akki](/wiki/Baliyan_Akki) - [Ben-K](/wiki/Ben-K) - Carlo Cannon - [Chris Brookes](/wiki/Chris_Brookes) - [Cima](/wiki/Cima_(wrestler)) - Craven - [Dante Chen](/wiki/Dante_Chen) - [Dash Chisako](/wiki/Dash_Chisako) - [El Lindaman](/wiki/El_Lindaman) - Emman Azman - [Emi Sakura](/wiki/Emi_Sakura) - [Harashima](/wiki/Harashima) - [Hiroyo Matsumoto](/wiki/Hiroyo_Matsumoto) - [Ho Ho Lun](/wiki/Ho_Ho_Lun) - [Indi Hartwell](/wiki/Indi_Hartwell) - [Issei Onitsuka](/wiki/Issei_Onitsuka) - [Jake de Leon](/wiki/Jake_de_Leon) - [Jason Lee](/wiki/Jason_Lee_(wrestler)) - Jibzy - [Joaquin Wilde](/wiki/Joaquin_Wilde) - [Johnny Gargano](/wiki/Johnny_Gargano) - [Kalisto](/wiki/Kalisto_(wrestler)) - [Kaz Hayashi](/wiki/Kaz_Hayashi) - Kasey - Kelly Kimberly Cheong - [Kenny Omega](/wiki/Kenny_Omega) - [Lokomotiv](/wiki/Ivan_Markov_(wrestler)) - [Lacey Lane](/wiki/Lacey_Lane) - [Makoto](/wiki/Makoto_(wrestler)) - [Mark Davis](/wiki/Mark_Davis_(wrestler)) - [Masa Takanashi](/wiki/Masa_Takanashi) - [Matt Cross](/wiki/Matt_Cross_(wrestler)) - [Meiko Satomura](/wiki/Meiko_Satomura) - [Mei Suruga](/wiki/Mei_Suruga) - [Michael Nakazawa](/wiki/Michael_Nakazawa) - [Miyu Yamashita](/wiki/Miyu_Yamashita) - [Mizuki](/wiki/Mizuki_(wrestler)) - Monomoth - [Nor 'Phoenix' Diana](/wiki/Nor_%27Phoenix%27_Diana) - [Pete Dunne](/wiki/Pete_Dunne) - [Reika Saiki](/wiki/Reika_Saiki) - [Rene Dupree](/wiki/Rene_Dupree) - [Riho](/wiki/Riho) - [Saki Akai](/wiki/Saki_Akai) - [Shaukat](/wiki/Shaukat_(wrestler)) - Shazza McKenzie - Shivam - [Shun Skywalker](/wiki/Shun_Skywalker) - [Sonjay Dutt](/wiki/Sonjay_Dutt) - Sultan Singh - [Susumu Yokosuka](/wiki/Susumu_Yokosuka) - [Tajiri](/wiki/Yoshihiro_Tajiri) - [Yoshi Tatsu](/wiki/Yoshi_Tatsu) - [Yuki Kamifuku](/wiki/Yuki_Kamifuku) - [Yukio Sakaguchi](/wiki/Yukio_Sakaguchi) - [T-Hawk](/wiki/T-Hawk_(wrestler)) - [Trent Seven](/wiki/Trent_Seven) - [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang_(wrestler)) - [Zeda Zhang](/wiki/Zeda_Zhang) ## Progression of champions ### SPW Southeast Asian Championship The **SPW Southeast Asian Championship** is the regional championship, and the primary and most prestigious title of the Singapore Pro Wrestling promotion.
