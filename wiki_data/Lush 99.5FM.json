At its launch, the station broadcast from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. daily. On 20 January 2005, the station expanded to 24-hour broadcasting. On 20 August 2009, the station relocated from [Caldecott Hill](/wiki/Caldecott_Hill) to studios at [Orchard Central](/wiki/Orchard_Central). On 7 July 2012, the station moved back to Caldecott Hill. Every week, various guest DJs would be invited on The Lush Mix, which aired on Saturdays from 8pm with repeats on weekdays from 9pm. After having been Mediacorp's lowest-rated radio station for several years, Lush was shut down on 1 September 2017. Mediacorp stated that it wanted to concentrate its efforts on its other English-language stations, and that Lush's remit of showcasing local music would be supplanted by the company-wide \"Singapore Sounds\" initiative. - [List of radio stations in Singapore](/wiki/List_of_radio_stations_in_Singapore) - Lush 99.5FM Live This article about a radio station in Asia is a stub.
