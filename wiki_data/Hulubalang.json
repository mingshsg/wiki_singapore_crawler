  "content": "* *Hulubalang** ([Jawi](/wiki/Jawi_script): هولوبالڠ) were the military nobility of the classical [Malay](/wiki/Malay_people) kingdoms in [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia). In western sources,[*which?*] \"*Hulubalang*\" is roughly translated as \"[warlord](/wiki/Warlord)\", \"commander\", \"general\" or simply \"warrior\". An early literary reference to the word *Hulubalang* appears in the [Malay Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals). It is mentioned in the text that among four senior nobles of [Kingdom of Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura) (1299–1398), there was a position called *Hulubalang Besar* (Grand *Hulubalang*), first held by Tun Tempurung, that equivalent to [chief of staff](/wiki/Chief_of_staff) of the army, who commands several other *Hulubalangs*. The legendary strongman of [Singapura](/wiki/Singapore), [Badang](/wiki/Badang), was among the notable *Hulubalang* of the kingdom, promoted to the rank during the reign of [Sri Rana Wikrama](/wiki/Sri_Rana_Wikrama). In the 15th century [Malacca Sultanate](/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate), the rank of Grand *Hulubalang* as the head of all *Hulubalangs* was preserved but more commonly known with the title 'Seri Bija Diraja' in the [Malay Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals). Among the most notable Seri Bija Diraja of Malacca was Tun Hamzah who lived during the reign of [Mansur Shah](/wiki/Mansur_Shah_of_Malacca). He was commonly known for his role along with [Tun Perak](/wiki/Tun_Perak), in leading the [Malaccan](/wiki/Malacca) army to victory against the [Siamese](/wiki/Siam) invaders and in the conquest of Pahang. As [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca) experiencing rapid expansion of its influence as a maritime empire[*citation needed*] in mid-15th century, it requires a similar office to control its naval forces separately, thus the rank of [Laksamana](/wiki/Laksamana) (grand admiral) was created, first held by [Hang Tuah](/wiki/Hang_Tuah). In [Aceh Sultanate](/wiki/Aceh_Sultanate), [Iskandar Muda](/wiki/Iskandar_Muda) (1583–1636) established a new nobility of warlords called *uleëbalang*, whom he gave districts (mukim) in feudal tenure. After his reign, however, the elite often supported weaker sultans, in order to maintain their own autonomy. In [Brunei Sultanate](/wiki/Brunei_Sultanate), the rank of *Manteri Hulubalang* (officials of defence) refers to lower ranking non-noble traditional officials.\n",
