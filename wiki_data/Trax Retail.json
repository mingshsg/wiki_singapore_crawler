Trax's services are available in 45 markets. Trax's development center opened in July 2012 in Tel Aviv.

Trax co-founders Joel Bar-El and Dror Feldheim are appointed Executive Chairman and President respectively. Bar-El heads efforts on corporate strategy, long-term vision and innovation and shareholder value creation.

Using Google Cloud Platform, Trax aims to deliver its Retail Watch image recognition product and machine learning capability to retailers to provide real-time shelf insights, such as out-of-stock products. ## Technology Trax's [computer vision](/wiki/Computer_vision) technology uses [artificial intelligence](/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence), fine-grained image recognition, and [machine learning](/wiki/Machine_learning) engines to convert store images into shelf insights. The technology can recognise products that are similar or identical, such as branded drinks or shampoo bottles but can also differentiate between them based on variety and size. Trax piloted its [machine learning algorithms](/wiki/Machine_learning_algorithms) with initial customers, allowing its algorithm to learn about different products. As the company processes more images, the better the technology gets at recognizing the same products in different shapes and sizes.\n",
