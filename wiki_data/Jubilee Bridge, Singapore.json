The construction of the bridge was suggested by then Prime Minister [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew). It was opened ahead of schedule due to his death. ## History In 2004, while visiting [Marina Bay](/wiki/Marina_Bay,_Singapore), then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew realised that pedestrians had to walk to [Esplanade Bridge](/wiki/Esplanade_Bridge) to cross the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River), which he believed to be too narrow. Due to this, Jubilee Bridge was designed to run along Esplanade Bridge at a lower and more pedestrian-friendly level. Plans for the bridge were first announced in 2009, and construction began in 2012. The bridge cost $17.7 million and 28 months to build. The bridge was to open in April 2015, but it was unofficially opened on 29 March following the [death of Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Lee_Kuan_Yew) as a final farewell. The bridge was opened by Prime Minister [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) as part of the Golden Jubilee Celebrations in 2015. The bridge was included in the [New Paper Big Walk](/wiki/New_Paper_Big_Walk) in 2015.
