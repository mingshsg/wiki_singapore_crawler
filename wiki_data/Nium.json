Please discuss further on the talk page. *(May 2024)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* **Nium** is a [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore)-headquartered cross-border payments company. Initially founded by Prajit Nanu and Michael Bermingham, and launched as a consumer-remittance platform [Instarem](/wiki/Instarem) in 2014. In 2016, the company introduced its B2B payments platform and rebranded as Nium in 2019, subsequently elevating Pratik Gandhi to co-founder in 2021.[*citation needed*] However, Gandhi left Nium in October 2023, around the time Nium's Chief Product Officer also left the company and Nium announced a layoff of over 10% of its global staff. ## History Founders Prajit Nanu and Michael Bermingham developed a solution[*buzzword*] to provide transparent and secure cross-border remittances for overseas money transfers with close to live exchange rates. Instarem was incorporated based on the premise of instant online remittances. By 2017, the company had begun to operate a cross-border payments platform targeted at business users, including banks and businesses. It opened offices in the UK, Hong Kong, Malaysia, acquiring Electronic Money Transfer licenses in Malaysia and the EU. It hit $1 billion USD in dollars processed in the same year. In 2018, real-time delivery of funds reached 50+ countries and the company launched its card-issuing platform. Subsequently, in 2019, the company rebranded to Nium with the launch of the Nium platform, with Instarem continuing to operate as a wholly owned consumer service. In 2021, the company made its first acquisitions: Ixaris, a travel payments optimization firm and then Wirecard Forex, a payments services company in India. In April 2022, Nium acquired the alternative payments network Socash.
