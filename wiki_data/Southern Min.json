'Southern Min language'), **Minnan** ([Mandarin](/wiki/Standard_Chinese) pronunciation: [mìn.nǎn]) or **Banlam** (Min Nan Chinese pronunciation: [bàn.lǎm]), is a group of linguistically similar and historically related [Chinese languages](/wiki/Varieties_of_Chinese) that form a branch of [Min Chinese](/wiki/Min_Chinese) spoken in [Fujian](/wiki/Fujian) (especially the [Minnan region](/wiki/Minnan_region)), most of [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan) (many citizens are descendants of settlers from Fujian), Eastern [Guangdong](/wiki/Guangdong), [Hainan](/wiki/Hainan), and Southern [Zhejiang](/wiki/Zhejiang). Southern Min dialects are also spoken by descendants of [emigrants from these areas](/wiki/Overseas_Chinese) in [diaspora](/wiki/Diaspora), most notably in [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia), such as [Singapore](/wiki/Singaporean_Hokkien), [Malaysia](/wiki/Southern_Peninsular_Malaysian_Hokkien), the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippine_Hokkien), [Indonesia](/wiki/Medan_Hokkien), [Brunei](/wiki/Ethnic_Chinese_in_Brunei), [Southern Thailand](/wiki/Thai_Chinese#Hokkien), [Myanmar](/wiki/Chinese_people_in_Myanmar#Hokkien), [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodian_Hokkien), [Southern and Central Vietnam](/wiki/Hoa_people#Ancestral_affiliations), as well as major cities in the United States, including [in San Francisco](/wiki/Chinese_in_San_Francisco), [in Los Angeles](/wiki/Chinese_in_Los_Angeles) and [in New York City](/wiki/Chinese_in_New_York_City). Minnan is the most widely-spoken branch of Min, with approximately 34 million native speakers as of 2025. The most widely spoken Southern Min language is [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien), which includes [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien). Other varieties of Southern Min have significant differences from Hokkien, some having limited [mutual intelligibility](/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility) with it, others almost none. [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect), [Longyan](/wiki/Longyan_Min), and [Zhenan](/wiki/Zhenan_Min) are said to have general mutual intelligibility with Hokkien, sharing similar phonology and vocabulary to a large extent. On the other hand, variants such as [Datian](/wiki/Datian_Min), [Zhongshan](/wiki/Zhongshan_Min), and [Qiong](/wiki/Hainanese_dialect)-[Lei](/wiki/Leizhou_Min) have historical linguistic roots with Hokkien, but are significantly divergent from it in terms of phonology and vocabulary, and thus have almost no mutual intelligibility with Hokkien. Linguists tend to classify them as separate languages. ## Geographic distribution ### China Southern Min dialects are spoken in southern [Fujian](/wiki/Fujian), specifically in the [cities](/wiki/List_of_administrative_divisions_of_Fujian) of [Xiamen](/wiki/Xiamen), [Quanzhou](/wiki/Quanzhou), [Zhangzhou](/wiki/Zhangzhou), and much of [Longyan](/wiki/Longyan), hence the name. In addition, varieties of Southern Min are spoken in several southeastern counties of [Wenzhou](/wiki/Wenzhou) in [Zhejiang](/wiki/Zhejiang), the [Zhoushan archipelago](/wiki/Zhoushan_archipelago) off [Ningbo](/wiki/Ningbo) in [Zhejiang](/wiki/Zhejiang), the town of [Sanxiang](/wiki/Sanxiang) at the southern periphery of [Zhongshan](/wiki/Zhongshan) in [Guangdong](/wiki/Guangdong), parts of [Huizhou](/wiki/Huizhou) and [Shanwei](/wiki/Shanwei) in Guangdong and in the [Chaoshan](/wiki/Chaoshan) (Teo-swa) region in Guangdong. The variant spoken in [Leizhou](/wiki/Leizhou), Guangdong as well as that in [Hainan](/wiki/Hainan) is classified as [Hainanese](/wiki/Hainanese) and is not mutually intelligible with mainstream Southern Min or Teochew. Hainanese is classified in some schemes as part of Southern Min and in other schemes as separate; among the latter, Hou combined Hainanese with Leizhou Min in a Qiong–Lei subgroup within Min, distinct from Southern Min. Some have even considered this distinction to be at the same level as the [Coastal Min](/wiki/Min_Chinese#Coastal_Min) – [Inland Min](/wiki/Min_Chinese#Inland_Min) distinction. [Puxian Min](/wiki/Puxian_Min) was originally based on the [Quanzhou dialect](/wiki/Quanzhou_dialect), but over time became heavily influenced by [Eastern Min](/wiki/Eastern_Min), eventually losing intelligibility with Southern Min. It is thus categorised into its own branch alongside Southern Min and Eastern Min. ### Taiwan The Southern Min dialects spoken in Taiwan, collectively known as [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien), is a [first language](/wiki/First_language) for most of the [Hoklo people](/wiki/Hoklo_people), the main ethnic group of Taiwan. The correspondence between language and ethnicity is not absolute, as some [Hoklo Taiwanese](/wiki/Hoklo_Taiwanese) people have very limited proficiency in Taiwanese while some non-Hoklo [Taiwanese people](/wiki/Taiwanese_people) (including [Hakkas](/wiki/Hakka_people) and [Indigenous](/wiki/Taiwanese_indigenous_peoples)) speak Taiwanese Southern Min fluently. ### Southeast Asia There are many Southern Min speakers among [overseas Chinese](/wiki/Overseas_Chinese) in [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia). Many ethnic [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_people) immigrants to the region were [Hoklo](/wiki/Hoklo_people) from southern Fujian and brought the language to what is now present-day [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) (formerly [British Malaya](/wiki/British_Malaya), the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements), and [British Borneo](/wiki/British_Borneo)), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia) (the former [Dutch East Indies](/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies)), the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines) (former [Spanish East Indies](/wiki/Spanish_East_Indies) and later, [US -Philippine Islands](/wiki/Insular_Government_of_the_Philippine_Islands)), [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei) (former part of [British Borneo](/wiki/British_Borneo)), [Southern Thailand](/wiki/Southern_Thailand), [Myanmar](/wiki/Myanmar) ([British Burma](/wiki/British_rule_in_Burma)), [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia) (former [French Cambodia](/wiki/French_protectorate_of_Cambodia) of [French Indochina](/wiki/French_Indochina)), [Southern](/wiki/Southern_Vietnam) [Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam) (former [French Cochinchina](/wiki/French_Cochinchina) of [French Indochina](/wiki/French_Indochina)) and [Central](/wiki/Central_Vietnam) [Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam) (former [French Annam](/wiki/Annam_(French_protectorate)) of [French Indochina](/wiki/French_Indochina)). In general, Southern Min from southern Fujian is known as [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien), Hokkienese, Fukien, or Fookien in [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia) and is mostly mutually intelligible with Hokkien spoken elsewhere. Many [Southeast Asian](/wiki/Southeast_Asia) ethnic Chinese also originated in the [Chaoshan](/wiki/Chaoshan) region of [Guangdong](/wiki/Guangdong) and speak [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_language), the variant of Southern Min from that region, particularly [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand), [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia), [Southern Vietnam](/wiki/Southern_Vietnam), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), etc. In the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines), [Philippine Hokkien](/wiki/Philippine_Hokkien) is reportedly the [native](/wiki/First_language) or [heritage language](/wiki/Heritage_language) of up to 98.7% of the [Chinese Filipino](/wiki/Chinese_Filipino) community, who refer to it as \"Lannang\" (*Lán-nâng-ōe*; lit. 'our people's language'). Southern Min speakers form the majority of Chinese in Singapore, with Hokkien being the largest group and the second largest being [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_people). Despite the similarities, the two groups are rarely viewed together as \"Southern Min\". ## Classification and varieties There are two or three major divisions of Southern Min, depending on the criteria for Leizhou and Hainanese inclusion: - **Southern Min** - [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) under the Quanzhang division (泉漳片) - [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect), [Swatow](/wiki/Swatow_dialect), [Jieyang](/wiki/Jieyang), [Haklau Min](/wiki/Haklau_Min) under the Chaoshan division (潮汕片) - [Leizhou](/wiki/Leizhou_Min) and [Hainanese](/wiki/Hainanese) dialects under the Qiong-Lei division (瓊雷片). More recently, Kwok (2018: 157) has proposed an alternative classification, with a divergent Northern branch that includes [Quanzhou dialect](/wiki/Quanzhou_dialect) but not [Zhangzhou dialect](/wiki/Zhangzhou_dialect), as shown below: - **Southern Min** - **Northern** - [Cangnan](/wiki/Cangnan) - [Quanzhou](/wiki/Quanzhou), [Zihu](/wiki/Yushan_County), [Lukang](/wiki/Lukang) - **Central-Southern** - **Central** - [Zhangzhou](/wiki/Zhangzhou) - [Longyan](/wiki/Longyan), [Datian](/wiki/Datian_County) - **Southern** - Guangdong - ? [Haifeng](/wiki/Haifeng) - [Jieyang](/wiki/Jieyang), [Chaoyang](/wiki/Chaoyang_District,_Shantou) - Hainan - [Leizhou](/wiki/Leizhou) - [Haikou](/wiki/Haikou) ### Hokkien Hokkien is the most widely spoken form of Southern Min, including [Amoy dialect](/wiki/Amoy_dialect) and [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien). Both of these developed as a combination of [Quanzhou](/wiki/Quanzhou_dialect) and [Zhangzhou](/wiki/Zhangzhou_dialect) speech. Varieties in South-East Asia include: [Singaporean Hokkien](/wiki/Singaporean_Hokkien), [Southern Peninsular Malaysian Hokkien](/wiki/Southern_Peninsular_Malaysian_Hokkien), and [Philippine Hokkien](/wiki/Philippine_Hokkien) (which are closer to Quanzhou Hokkien), and [Penang Hokkien](/wiki/Penang_Hokkien) and [Medan Hokkien](/wiki/Medan_Hokkien) (which are closer to Zhangzhou Hokkien). ### Teochew Teochew is a closely related to Hokkien, with several variants spoken across the [Chaoshan](/wiki/Chaoshan) region. Some also consider [Haklau Min](/wiki/Haklau_Min) to be part of Teochew. Despite the close relationship, Teochew and Hokkien are different enough in both pronunciation and vocabulary that mutual intelligibility is difficult. ### Other varieties [Zhenan Min](/wiki/Zhenan_Min), a dialect island in [Zhejiang](/wiki/Zhejiang) province, is closely related to Quanzhou Hokkien. [Haklau Min](/wiki/Haklau_Min), spoken around [Shanwei](/wiki/Shanwei) and [Haifeng](/wiki/Haifeng), differs markedly from neighbouring [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect) and may represent a later migration from Zhangzhou. Linguistically, it lies between Teochew and Amoy. [Datian Min](/wiki/Datian_Min), spoken in [Datian County](/wiki/Datian_County) in [Fujian](/wiki/Fujian) province, has been influenced by other Min varieties. [Sanxiang Min](/wiki/Sanxiang_Min) is spoken in a dialect island in [Guangdong](/wiki/Guangdong) province. ## Phonology Southern Min has one of the most diverse phonologies of Chinese varieties, with more consonants than Mandarin or Cantonese. Vowels, on the other hand, are more-or-less similar to those of Mandarin. In general, Southern Min dialects have five to six [tones](/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)), and [tone sandhi](/wiki/Tone_sandhi) is extensive. There are minor variations within Hokkien, and the Teochew system differs somewhat more. Southern Min's [nasal](/wiki/Nasal_consonant) [finals](/wiki/Final_(linguistics)) consist of /m/, /n/, /ŋ/, and /~/. ### Sino-Xenic comparisons\n",
