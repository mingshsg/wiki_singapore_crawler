  "content": "Singaporean writer **Chua Jim Neo** ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 蔡認娘; [Pe̍h-ōe-jī](/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB): *Chhòa Jīn-niû*; 17 February 1907 – 8 August 1980) was a Singaporean chef and cookbook writer best known for *Mrs. Lee's Cookbook*, which preserves the recipes of [Peranakan cuisine](/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine). Chua was also the mother of [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew), the first [Prime Minister of Singapore](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) and the paternal grandmother of [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong), the third Prime Minister of Singapore. ## Biography Chua was born in Singapore in 1905 to Chua Kim Teng, a wealthy local businessman, and Liong A Soen (aka Neo Ah Soon), a [Chinese Indonesian](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian) of [Hakka](/wiki/Hakka_people) descent who hailed from [Pontianak](/wiki/Pontianak), [West Kalimantan](/wiki/West_Kalimantan), [Dutch East Indies](/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies) (present-day [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia)). While her father was born in Singapore, her paternal grandfather came from a [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien_people) Peranakan family in [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) with ancestry from [Haicheng](/wiki/Haicheng,_Fujian), [Zhangzhou](/wiki/Zhangzhou), [Fujian](/wiki/Fujian). Her parents then arranged a marriage for her to a storekeeper named [Lee Chin Koon](/wiki/Lee_Chin_Koon) and they married when she was sixteen, whilst he was eighteen years old in 1921. Chua and Lee had five children, four sons and a daughter, her first-born was [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) who went on to become the first [Prime Minister of Singapore](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore). Chua saved her family jewelry and money, managing household finances and helping Kuan Yew attend law school in Britain. In 1974, she wrote *Mrs. Lee's Cookbook: Nonya Recipes and Other Favorite Recipes* in order to preserve the heritage of [Peranakan cuisine](/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine) (also known as *nyonya* or *nyonya/baba* cuisine), which combines [Straits Chinese](/wiki/Peranakan) cooking with [Malay-style cooking](/wiki/Malay_cuisine). Chua, a nyonya ([Peranakan](/wiki/Peranakan) Chinese woman), was considered a \"highly respected authority\" on the subject. The original publication included a preface by her cousin [Wee Kim Wee](/wiki/Wee_Kim_Wee), who was then serving as the high commissioner to Malaysia and would later become [President of Singapore](/wiki/President_of_Singapore). The cookbook was updated and republished in 2003 by her granddaughter, Lee Shermay. Chua died on 7 August 1980, aged 75 and was cremated at the [Mount Vernon Columbarium](/wiki/Mount_Vernon_Columbarium). She was inducted posthumously in to the [Singapore Women's Hall of Fame](/wiki/Singapore_Women%27s_Hall_of_Fame) in 2015.\n",
