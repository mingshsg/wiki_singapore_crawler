  "content": "Dialect of Hokkien spoken in Singapore **Singaporean Hokkien**[c] is a local variety of the [Hokkien language](/wiki/Hokkien_language) spoken natively in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). Within Chinese linguistic academic circles, this dialect is known as **Sin-ka-pho Ban-lam Gu**.[d] It bears similarities with the [Amoy dialect](/wiki/Amoy_dialect) in [Xiamen](/wiki/Xiamen) and [Taiwanese Hokkien](/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien) in [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan). [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) is the [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min) pronunciation for the province of [Fujian](/wiki/Fujian), and is generally the term used by the [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_people) in Southeast Asia to refer to the Quanzhang dialects.[e] Singaporean Hokkien heavily views the Amoy dialect as its [prestige](/wiki/Prestige_(sociolinguistics)), and its accent is predominantly based on a mixture of [Quanzhou](/wiki/Quanzhou_dialects) and [Zhangzhou](/wiki/Zhangzhou_dialects) speech, with a greater inclination towards the former instead of the latter. Nevertheless, the grammar and tones of Singaporean Hokkien are still largely based on standard Hokkien. When compared to the prestige [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien) accent[f] spoken in [Tainan](/wiki/Tainan) and [Kaohsiung](/wiki/Kaohsiung), the accent and pronunciation of Singaporean Hokkien inclines towards [Quanzhou](/wiki/Quanzhou_dialects), which is also close to the pronunciation of [Taipei](/wiki/Taipei) and [Xiamen](/wiki/Xiamen), and is less close to that of [Tainan](/wiki/Tainan), which has a greater inclination towards [Zhangzhou](/wiki/Zhangzhou_dialects).[g] Like many spoken languages in Singapore, Singaporean Hokkien is influenced by other languages or dialects spoken in Singapore. For instance, Singaporean Hokkien is influenced to a certain degree by [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_Min), and is sometimes regarded by non-Singaporean speakers as a combined Hokkien–Teochew speech. In addition, it incorporates many [loanwords](/wiki/Loanwords) from Singapore's four official languages: [English](/wiki/Singapore_English), [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language), [Mandarin](/wiki/Singaporean_Mandarin) and [Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_language). Because of its historical prevalence in Singapore, Singaporean Hokkien has also exerted [significant influence](/wiki/Hokkien_influence_on_Singaporean_Mandarin) on the Singaporean variant of Mandarin. ## History From the 19th until the early half of the 20th century, there was a large influx of Chinese migrants from southern China into Singapore. This led to [Chinese](/wiki/Overseas_Chinese) constituting almost 75% of Singapore's population. Of these Chinese, many originated from the regions of [Amoy/Xiamen](/wiki/Xiamen), [Quanzhou](/wiki/Quanzhou) and [Zhangzhou](/wiki/Zhangzhou) in [Fujian](/wiki/Fujian) province. They brought [Southern Min](/wiki/Southern_Min) to Singapore, which was then propagated throughout the Malayan region. As there was no formal Chinese name for Southern Min in the early 20th century, these migrants began to use their place of origin as the name of their speech, and thus called the dialect \"[Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien)\", referring to Fujian province. During the 19th century, many traditional private Chinese schools in Singapore (referred to as 私塾仔; *su-sio̍k-á*) generally used Hokkien to teach [Chinese classics](/wiki/Chinese_classics) and [Classical Chinese](/wiki/Classical_Chinese). However, by the early 20th century, Mandarin began to replace Hokkien as the medium of instructions in Chinese schools after the founding of many Mandarin-medium schools. During the 1950s and 1960s, many political speeches in Singapore were in Hokkien, in order to reach out to the [Chinese community in Singapore](/wiki/Chinese_Singaporean). There was also a thriving Hokkien cultural scene that included Hokkien story-telling, opera, and media in Singapore. After 1979, the Singapore government began to push for the use of Mandarin in Singapore, spearheaded by the [Speak Mandarin Campaign](/wiki/Speak_Mandarin_Campaign). Following this, the Singapore government also began to employ a more stringent censorship, or ban, of Hokkien media in the Singaporean Chinese media. Consequently, all Hokkien-language media in Singapore had to be dubbed in Mandarin before being allowed to stream on national TV. In addition, the 1980s saw Chinese-medium education replaced by that in English, causing English to emerge as the most widely used language in Singapore. The emergence of the English language, coupled with heavy promotion of Mandarin, generally led Hokkien to decline in Singapore after 1979. ## Current status Today, the [lingua franca](/wiki/Lingua_franca) of the [Chinese community in Singapore](/wiki/Chinese_Singaporean) is [Mandarin](/wiki/Singaporean_Mandarin). Although Hokkien is still widely spoken in Singapore today, it is not as widespread as before and is mostly restricted to the older generations. The most common places to hear Hokkien spoken in Singapore are at the country's [hawker centres](/wiki/Hawker_centre) or [kopi tiams](/wiki/Kopi_tiam). Speaking ability varies amongst the different age groups of the Hokkien Singaporeans. The elderly are generally able to communicate effectively in Hokkien. On the other hand, the middle and younger generations, while generally proficient, have generally lost the ability to communicate as fluently. However, when it comes to using profanities, majority of the younger generation, even among non-Chinese Singaporeans, listed Hokkien as the first out of all languages and dialects. With the Speak Mandarin Campaign from the government, the Hokkien speaking population has been on a gradual decline. ### Revival There is, however, groups of Hokkien Singaporeans working to help preserve, spread and revive the use of Singaporean Hokkien in the country. The ease of access to online Hokkien entertainment media and pop music from the internet has helped to connect to the language and culture. Many Singaporeans are increasingly using online and social media platforms to learn, discuss, meet, and interact with each other in Hokkien. ## Phonology Note: In this article, the [Tâi-lô](/wiki/T%C3%A2i-u%C3%A2n_L%C3%B4-m%C3%A1-j%C4%AB_Phing-im_Hong-%C3%A0n) romanization system is used. ### Consonants Initials BilabialAlveolarAlveolo- palatalVelarGlottalplainsibilantNasalm [[m](/wiki/Voiced_bilabial_nasal)] 名 (miâ)n [[n](/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_nasal)] 耐 (nāi)ng [[ŋ](/wiki/Voiced_velar_nasal)] 硬 (ngē)Plosiveplainp [[p](/wiki/Voiceless_bilabial_plosive)] 邊 (pian)t [[t](/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_plosive)] 地 (tē)ts [[ts](/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_affricate)] 曾 (tsan)tsi [[tɕ](/wiki/Voiceless_alveolo-palatal_affricate)] 祝 (tsiok)k [[k](/wiki/Voiceless_velar_plosive)] 求 (kiû)[[ʔ](/wiki/Glottal_stop)] 音 (im)aspiratedph [[pʰ](/wiki/Aspirated_consonant)] 波 (pho)th [[tʰ](/wiki/Aspirated_consonant)] 他 (thann)tsh [[tsʰ](/wiki/Aspirated_consonant)] 出 (tshut)tshi [[tɕʰ](/wiki/Aspirated_consonant)] 手 (tshiú)kh [[kʰ](/wiki/Aspirated_consonant)] 去 (khì)voicedb [[b](/wiki/Voiced_bilabial_plosive)][i] 文 (bûn)d [[d](/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_plosive)][ii] 日 (di̍t)j [[dz](/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_affricate)]* 熱 (jua̍h)ji [[dʑ](/wiki/Voiced_alveolo-palatal_affricate)]* 入 (ji̍p)g [[g](/wiki/Voiced_velar_plosive)][i] 牛 (gû)Fricatives [[s](/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_fricative)] 衫 (sann)si [[ɕ](/wiki/Voiceless_alveolo-palatal_fricative)] 心 (sim)h [[h](/wiki/Voiceless_glottal_fricative)] 喜 (hí)Approximantl [[l](/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_lateral_approximant)] 柳 (liú)w [[w](/wiki/Voiced_labial%E2%80%93velar_approximant)] 我 (wá)Finals [Bilabial](/wiki/Bilabial_consonant)[Alveolar](/wiki/Alveolar_consonant)[Velar](/wiki/Velar_consonant)[Glottal](/wiki/Glottal_consonant)[Nasal consonant](/wiki/Nasal_consonant)-m [[m](/wiki/Voiced_bilabial_nasal)] 心 (si**m**)-n [[n](/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_nasal)] 今 (ki**n**)-ng [[ŋ](/wiki/Voiced_velar_nasal)] 興 (he**ng**)[Stop consonant](/wiki/Stop_consonant)-p [[p̚](/wiki/No_audible_release)] 急 (ki**p**)-t [[t̚](/wiki/No_audible_release)] 越 (ua̍**t**)-k [[k̚](/wiki/No_audible_release)] 速 (so**k**)-h [[ʔ](/wiki/Glottal_stop)] 物 (mi**h**)[Syllabic consonant](/wiki/Syllabic_consonant) [Bilabial](/wiki/Bilabial_consonant)[Velar](/wiki/Velar_consonant)[Nasal](/wiki/Nasal_consonant)m [[m̩](/wiki/Syllabic_consonant)] 毋 (**m̄**)ng [[ŋ̍](/wiki/Syllabic_consonant)] 酸 (s**ng**) ### Vowels Monophthongs [Front](/wiki/Front_vowel)[Central](/wiki/Central_vowel)[Back](/wiki/Back_vowel)oral[nasal](/wiki/Nasal_vowel)oral[nasal](/wiki/Nasal_vowel)[Close](/wiki/Close_vowel)i [[i](/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel)] 伊 (**i**)inn [[ĩ](/wiki/Nasal_vowel)] 圓 (**înn**)ir [[ɨ](/wiki/Close_central_unrounded_vowel)] 豬 (t**ir**)u [[u](/wiki/Close_back_rounded_vowel)] 有 (**ū**)unn [[ũ](/wiki/Nasal_vowel)] 羊 (i**ûnn**)[Close-Mid](/wiki/Close-mid_vowel)e [[e](/wiki/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel)] 會(**ē**)enn [[ẽ](/wiki/Nasal_vowel)] 嬰 (**enn**)o [[o](/wiki/Close-mid_back_rounded_vowel)] 蠔 (**ô**)[Mid](/wiki/Mid_vowel)er [[ə](/wiki/Mid_central_vowel)] 鍋 (**er**)[Open-Mid](/wiki/Open-mid_vowel)oo [[ɔ](/wiki/Open-mid_back_rounded_vowel)] 烏 (**oo**)onn [[ɔ̃](/wiki/Nasal_vowel)] 嗚 (**onn**)[Open](/wiki/Open_vowel)a [[a](/wiki/Open_front_unrounded_vowel)] 亞 (**a**)ann [[ã](/wiki/Nasal_vowel)] 餡 (**ānn**)Diphthongs & Triphthongs [Diphthong](/wiki/Diphthong)[Triphthong](/wiki/Triphthong)ai [ai] 愛 (**ài**)ia [ia] 椰 (**iâ**)io [io] 腰 (**io**)ua [ua] 娃 (**ua**)ui [ui] 為 (**uī**)iau [iau] 枵 (**iau**)au [au] 後 (**āu**)ia [iɛ] 燕 (**ià**n)[i]iu [iu] 油 (**iû**)ue [ue] 話 (**uē**)uai [uai] 歪 (**uai**) ### Tones Singaporean Hokkien tones [Tones](/wiki/Four_tones_(Middle_Chinese))Upper/Dark (陰)Lower/Light (陽)[No.](/wiki/Tone_number)[Name](/wiki/Tone_name)[TL](/wiki/T%C3%A2i-l%C3%B4)e.g.Pitch Contour[No.](/wiki/Tone_number)[Name](/wiki/Tone_name)[TL](/wiki/T%C3%A2i-l%C3%B4)e.g.Pitch ContourOriginal[Sandhied](/wiki/Tone_sandhi)Original[Sandhied](/wiki/Tone_sandhi)Level (平)1陰平 *im-piânn*a詩 *si*[˦˦] (44)[˨˨] (22)5陽平 *iông-piânn*â時 *sî*[˨˦] (24)[˨˩] (21)Rising (上)2上聲 *sióng-siann*á死 *sí*[˦˨] (42)[˨˦] (24)－Departing (去)3陰去 *im-khì*à四 *sì*[˨˩] (21)[˦˨] (42)7陽去 *iông-khì*ā是 *sī*[˨˨] (22)[˨˩] (21)[Entering (入)](/wiki/Checked_tone)4陰入 *im-ji̍p*a◌薛 *sih*[ʔ˧˨] (32)[ʔ˦˨] (42)8陽入 *iông-ji̍p*a̍◌蝕 *si̍h*[ʔ˦˧] (43)[ʔ˨˩] (21)[ʔ˦] (4)[ʔ˦] (4)NoteEntering tones (4 & 8) only occur in closed syllables where ◌ represents either *-p*, *-t*, *-k*, or *-h*. ### Variation #### Regional accents and tones When Singaporeans speak Hokkien, they do so with various accents and tones largely from [Tong'an](/wiki/Tong%27an_District), [Anxi](/wiki/Anxi_County), [Nan'an](/wiki/Nan%27an,_Fujian), [Kinmen](/wiki/Kinmen) as well as [Yongchun](/wiki/Yongchun_County), [Jinjiang](/wiki/Jinjiang,_Fujian), [Longhai City](/wiki/Longhai_City) and Southern [Zhangzhou](/wiki/Zhangzhou) accents. In practice, it is common for Singaporeans to mix English conjunctions such as \"and\" into a Hokkien sentence. Some would include *honn* (乎) (an exclamatory remark in [Jinjiang](/wiki/Jinjiang,_Fujian) / [Nan'an](/wiki/Nan%27an,_Fujian)), in addition to the widely used Hokkien exclamatory particles *la* (啦) or *loo* (囉). #### No distinction between literary and vernacular readings In saying years or numbers, Singaporean Hokkien normally does not differentiate between literary (文讀音) or vernacular (白讀音) readings of Chinese characters. In Taiwan or Amoy, a distinction is usually made. For instance, the year *1980* would be said with a literary pronunciation (一九八空年; *it kiú pat khòng nî*); but in Singapore, no differentiation is made and is pronounced as otherwise vernacular *it káu pueh khòng nî*. As another instance, Taiwanese would speak telephone numbers using literary readings, whereas Singaporeans would use vernacular ones instead. For example, the telephone number *98444678* will be pronounced in Taiwan as *kiú pat sù sù sù lio̍k tshit pat*, where in Singaporean Hokkien it would be pronounced as *káu pueh sì-sì sì la̍k tshit pueh*. ### Influence from Southern Zhangzhou and Teochew Phonology #### Vowel shift from *ing* to *eng* In Singaporean Hokkien, as compared to Quanzhou (whose accent Hokkien usually inclines toward), Zhangzhou, [Amoy](/wiki/Amoy_Hokkien) or [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien), which pronounce the vowel *ing*—there is a vowel change from *ing* (/iŋ/ or /iəŋ/) to *eng* (/eŋ/ or /ɛŋ/). This change is similar to pronunciation in regions south of Zhangzhou—[Dongshan](/wiki/Dongshan_County), [Yunxiao](/wiki/Yunxiao_County), [Zhangpu](/wiki/Zhangpu_County), [Pinghe](/wiki/Pinghe_County), [Zhao'an](/wiki/Zhao%27an) counties (southern Zhangzhou accent)—and in [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect) and Cantonese. Below is a table illustrating the difference: [Hanzi](/wiki/Hanzi)Singaporean HokkienAmoy HokkienEnglish生*seng**sing*to live清*tseng**tshing*clear明*bêng**bîng*bright冷*léng**líng*cold英*eng**ing*brave政*tsèng**tsìng*political #### Pronunciation of 'I' In Amoy Hokkien pronunciation, 我 (lit. 'I/me') is pronounced as /ɡua˥˨/; but in Singapore, it is pronounced as /wa˥˨/, which is alleged by some to have been influenced by the Teochew pronunciation /ua˥˨/ although other dialects like [Putianese](/wiki/Putian_dialect) and some regional Hokkien dialects including most Taiwanese Hokkien dialects also pronounce it as /ua˥˨/. ## Grammar There are some differences between the sentence structure used by Singaporean Hokkien and by Amoy/Taiwanese Hokkien. For instance, when asking a question \"do you want to...?\", Singaporean Hokkien typically uses the sentence structure 愛……莫？ (*ai…mài?*), whereas Taiwan uses 欲……無？ (*beh…bô?*). The word 愛 (*ai*) is commonly used in Singaporean Hokkien to mean \"want to\", but in Amoy Hokkien and Taiwan Hokkien, the word 欲/卜 (*beh*) (which means \"want\" in Hokkien) is used instead. 愛 (*ai*) in Amoy and Taiwanese Hokkien it typically means \"love to\" or \"need to\". Also, unlike Taiwanese Hokkien—which typically uses the word 敢 (*kám*) (meaning \"whether or not\") when asking a question, which is more formal or polite—Singaporean Hokkien does not use the word 敢 (*kám*). Instead, it simply adds the word 無 (*bô*) at the end of the sentence to indicate that it is a question (similar to Mandarin's 嗎 (*ma*) or adds a Cantonese intonation 咩 (*me1*) at the end. Adding the word 無 (*bô*) at the end of a sentence is also used in Taiwanese Hokkien, when one is asking a question in an informal way. **Differences in sentence structure** Singaporean HokkienAmoyEnglish愛食飯莫？ *ai tsia̍h-pn̄g mài?*欲食飯無？ *beh tsia̍h-pn̄g bô?*Do you want to eat?汝有睏飽無？ *lír ū khùn-pá bô?*汝敢有睏飽？ *lí kám ū khùn-pá?*Did you have enough sleep? ## Numerals The following list shows the colloquial readings of the numerals used to count objects.

In some cases, the literary reading of the number must then be used. For example, 第一 = *tē-it*, 第二 = *tē-jī*. ## Differences from other Hokkien varieties There are minor differences between Singaporean Hokkien and [Amoy](/wiki/Amoy_Hokkien) or [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien) in terms of vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar. [Amoy](/wiki/Amoy_Hokkien) and [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien) bear close resemblance, and are usually considered the prestige dialect of Hokkien, differing only in terms of [vocabulary](/wiki/Lexicon). ### Unique vocabulary Although Singaporean Hokkien is similar to [Amoy](/wiki/Amoy_Hokkien) or [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien), there exist certain unique Singaporean Hokkien words, which are different from those two aforementioned dialects. Singaporean HokkienAmoy HokkienDefinition死景 *sí-kéng*博物館 *phok-bu̍t-kuán*museum活景 *ua̍h-kéng*動物園 *tōng-bu̍t-hn̂g*zoo掠無球 *lia̍h-bô-kiû/m̄-bat*毋捌 *m̄-bat*completely not understand (lit. catch no balls)假強 *kê-khiàng*假𠢕 *ké-gâu*act smart (overdo it; Singapore especially for women)俏母 *tshiò-bú*媠查某 *súi tsa-bóo*pretty lady督公 *tok-kong*讚 *tsàn*superb (originated from [Na Tuk Kong](/wiki/Na_Tuk_Kong)) ### Same meaning, different words Singaporean HokkienDefinitionAmoy/Taiwanese HokkienNotes愛 *ài*Want欲 *beh*愛 *ài* in Amoy means \"love\" or \"must\". 欲 in Singaporean Hokkien can be classified as an auxiliary verb denoting volition of the following verb. 欲 *beh* is sometimes written alternatively as 卜 *beh*. 恁儂 / 恁人 *lín lâng*You-all恁 *lín*The use of 儂/人 lâng in Singaporean Hokkien pronoun (I, you, we) originated from Teochew grammar.我儂 / 我人 *uá lâng*We阮 / 咱 *gún* / *lán*阮儂 *gún lâng*, 咱 *lán* and 咱儂 *lán lâng* are also used in Singaporean Hokkien. Quanzhou and Zhangzhou uses 阮 *gún*, whereas Amoy uses 阮 *gún/guán* in a manner similar to Taiwanese.伊儂 / 伊人 *i-lâng*They𪜶 (亻因) *in*This word has been shortened into the term 𪜶 (亻因) *in* in Taiwanese, Amoy, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou Hokkien whilst Longyan, Singapore, and Malaysian Hokkien preserve this older element of the language.錯 *tshò*Wrong毋著 *m̄-tio̍h*The Malay word *salah* is actually more commonly used to mean 'wrong' in Singaporean Hokkien. 毋著 *m̀-tio̍h* is also used in Singaporean Hokkien.舊早 *kū-tsá*In the past頂擺 / 以前 *téng-mái* / *í-tsêng*All variants are used in Amoy/Taiwanese.鬥跤手 *tàu-kha-tshiú*Help鬥相共 *tàu-sann-kāng*All variants are used in Amoy / Taiwanese.卽兜 *tsit-tâu*This place這爿 / 遮 *tsit-pêng* / *tsiâ*這爿 *tsit-pêng* is also commonly used in Singapore, 遮 *tsiâ* less so. 這 *tsit* is sometimes written alternatively as 即 or 今. 按呢款 *án-ne-khuán*In this way, so按呢 *án-ne*/*án-ni*款 *khuán* is not generally appended in Amoy / Taiwanese幾鐳 / 幾箍 *kui-lui* / *kui khoo*How much?偌濟錢 *juā-tsuē tsînn*All variants are used in Amoy. Both 鐳 *lui* and 錢 *tsînn* are used in [Minnan region](/wiki/Minnan_region) today to mean \"money\". In Singapore however, 鐳 *lui* is more commonly used to mean \"money\". The word 鐳 *lui* was previously thought to have originated from Malay. However, research indicated that the word 鐳 *lui* is in fact a unique Hokkien word, originating from the unit of currency known as 銅鐳 *tâng-lui* during the early [Chinese Republican](/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%9349)) period. It actually means \"bronze money\". 銅鐳 *tâng-lui* was commonly used in [Minnan region](/wiki/Minnan_region) and [Chaoshan](/wiki/Chaoshan) region during that time, and the term spread to Singapore then and remains in common use until today. 鐳 *lui* used to be used in Taiwan, but due to [Japanese colonial rule](/wiki/Taiwan_under_Japanese_rule) fell out of use. It was replaced by 錢 *tsînn* which is the normal term for \"money\" in Taiwan today.轉厝 *tńg-tshū*Go home倒去 *to-khì*轉去 *to-khì* is used in Singapore as well, but with a more general meaning of \"going back\", not specifically home.今仔日 *kiann-ji̍t*Today今仔日 *kin-á-ji̍t*Singapore '今仔'日 *kiann-ji̍t* is a contraction of Amoy 今仔日 *kin-á-ji̍t*. 今日 *kin-ji̍t* is also heard in Singapore.當今 *tong-kim*Nowadays現此時 *hián-tsú-sî*Both Singapore and Amoy/Taiwanese commonly use 這陣 *tsit-tsūn* to encompass the meaning of \"nowadays\". 現此時 *hián-tshú-sî* is commonly used in Taiwanese.即陣 *tsit-tsūn*Now這馬 / 這站 *tsit-má* / *tsit-tsām*這陣 *tsit-tsūn* is also used in Amoy / Taiwanese四散 *sì-suānn*anyhow/casual/random烏白 *oo-pe̍h*E.g. 伊四散講 *i sì-suānn kóng* - He speaks casually (or nonsense). 四散 *sì-suānn* is sometimes also used in Amoy, and regularly used in Teochew.定著 *tiānn-tio̍h*surely一定 / 絕對 *it-tīng* / *tsua̍t-tùi*定著 *tiānn-tio̍h* is sometimes also used in Taiwan. 一定 *it-tīng* is a loan from Mandarin.驚輸 *kiann-su*Fear of losing out/failure - [kiasu](/wiki/Kiasu)驚失敗 *kiann sit-pāi*公私 *kong-si*Share分 / 公家 *pun* / *kong-ke*正 *tsiā*Very真 *tsin*傷 *siong*Very tough or difficult艱難 / 困難 *kan-lân* / *khùn-lân*傷 *siong* literally means \"injurious\", but has become slang in Singapore for \"tough\" or \"difficult\"幸 *heng*Luckily, fortunately好佳哉 *hó-ka-tsài*食風 *tsia̍h-hong*To go on holiday, or more generally to live in luxury𨑨迌 *tshit-thô*In Amoy / Taiwanese, 食風 *tsia̍h-hong* is also used but means \"facing the wind\". In Singapore, 𨑨迌 *tshit-thô* means simply \"to play\" (as in children playing). ### Same word, different pronunciation There are some words used in Singaporean Hokkien that are the same in Taiwanese Hokkien, but are pronounced differently. Hokkien WordsDefinitionSingaporean HokkienTaiwanese HokkienNotes咖啡Coffee*ko-pi**ka-pi*\"*ko-pi*\" is a loan word from the Malay word \"*kopi*\" which in turn is taken from the English word \"*coffee*\" The Mandarin word \"*kāfēi*\" and the Taiwanese Hokkien word \"*ka-pi*\" are derived from the French word \"*café*\". As Hokkien does not have an f-sound, this turned into a p-sound. Philippine Hokkien pronounces the word for \"coffee\" as \"*ka-pé*\" which is also a loan word from the Filipino/Tagalog word \"*kape*\", which is also derived from the Spanish word \"*café*\".按怎How*án-tsuánn**án-nuá*\"*án-tsuánn*\" is also commonly used in Taiwan. The pronunciation of \"*án-nuá*\" originates from Zhangzhou.啥物/甚物What*si-mih/sim-mih**siánn-mi̍h*\"*si-mih/sim-mih*\" is based on the word 甚物 (used in Amoy/Zhangzhou), whereas \"*siánn-mi̍h*\" is based on the word 啥物 (used in Quanzhou). Taiwan typically uses \"啥物 *siánn-mi̍h*\" more often, although \"甚物 *sim-mih*\" is also used. Singapore also uses \"啥物 *siánn-mi̍h*\", though less often. ## Influences from other languages Because Singapore is a multilingual country, Singaporean Hokkien has been influenced by many other languages spoken in Singapore. As a result, there are many non-Hokkien words that have been imported into Singaporean Hokkien, such as those from Malay, Teochew, Cantonese, and English. ### Loanwords from other Chinese varieties There are words in Singaporean Hokkien that originated from other Chinese variants spoken in Singapore. Singaporean HokkienDefinitionAmoy HokkienNotes偏 *phinn*Cheap俗 *sio̍k*偏 *phinn* originates from Teochew. 俗 *sio̍k* also used in Amoy/Quanzhou/Zhangzhou死爸 *sí-pē*Very眞 / 足 *tsin* / *tsiok*Originated from Teochew word 死爸 *sí-pĕ*. Interchangeably used in Singaporean Hokkien, which can coincide with the Hokkien pronunciation of 死爸 *sí-pē*. The word 死爸 *sí-pē* in original Hokkien is a vulgar word that means \"to the extent that your/my father dies\".山龜 *suānn-ku*Country-bumpkin土包仔 *thóo-pau-á*Originated from Teochew, lit. \"mountain tortoise\"無便 *bô-piàn*There is no way (nothing can be done)無法度 *bô-huat-tō*Originated from Teochew做儛 *tsò-bú*together做伙 / 做陣 / 鬭陣 *tsuè-he* / *tsuè-tīn* / *tàu-tīn*Originated from Teochew緊張 *kán-tsiong*Nervous緊張 *kín-tiunn*Originated from Cantonese ### Malay loanwords The following are the common Malay loanwords used in Singaporean Hokkien.

Alternatively, 老君 lo-kun is related to Taoist's deity [Daode Tianzun](/wiki/Daode_Tianzun), which is commonly known as Taishang Laojun (太上老君) \"The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord\". Many Chinese in Singapore practiced Taoism and visited Taoist temples to prescribe medicine to cure their disease. Naturally, the deity became like a doctor. Lokun 老君 can also mean a wise man. ### English loanwords There are also many English loanwords used in Singaporean Hokkien. They are usually used when the speaker does not know the Hokkien equivalent. Some of these English terms are related to working and living in Singapore English loanwords in Singaporean HokkienCompare Taiwanese HokkienShopping踅街 (se̍h-kue)MRT地鐵 (tē-thih) or 捷運 (tsia̍t-ūn)But但是 (tān-sī) or 毋過 (m̄-koh)Toilet便所 (piān-sóo) ## Vocabulary from Old Chinese Certain [colloquial](/wiki/Literary_and_colloquial_readings_of_Chinese_characters) pronunciations of Singaporean Hokkien words are directly inherited from the [consonant](/wiki/Consonant) system of [Old Chinese](/wiki/Old_Chinese). Hokkien did not experience a great phonological change throughout the transition period from [Old Chinese](/wiki/Old_Chinese) to [Middle Chinese](/wiki/Middle_Chinese). Min dialects, including Hokkien, preserved a unique feature of [Old Chinese](/wiki/Old_Chinese): it does not have [labiodental consonants](/wiki/Labiodental_consonants). For instance, the word \"分\" is pronounced as *fen* in Mandarin, but as *pun* in Hokkien. This marks a major difference between [Old Chinese](/wiki/Old_Chinese) and [Middle Chinese](/wiki/Middle_Chinese).

Most [Tangki](/wiki/Tangki) or Chinese mediums from Hokkien temples also communicate in Hokkien during spiritual consultation. Some of the Chinese Buddhist temples in Singapore continue to recite the [Buddhist scriptures](/wiki/Buddhist_scriptures) in Hokkien during their daily worship services. The scriptures contain Singapore-style Hokkien romanization are available to assist during the scriptural recitation. There are also Hokkien Buddhist sermons CDs made available and distribute among Hokkien communities in Singapore and overseas. Some of the Chinese Christian churches in Singapore also have services conducted in Singaporean Hokkien. ### Music There exist Singaporean Hokkien writings, folk adages, and ballads written by early Chinese immigrants to Singapore. Amongst the folk ballads, a few outstanding writings tell of the history and hardship of early Chinese immigrants to Singapore. There are 18 sections in the poetry ballad \"行船歌\" (*Hâng-tsûn-kua*) (\"Songs of traveling on a boat\"), which talks about how early immigrants migrated to Singapore. There is another ballad called \"砰嘭水中流\" (*Pin-pong-tsúi-tiong-lâu*) (\"Flow in the midst of water\"): > 乞 > > kih > > 涸 > > kok > > 木 > > bo̍k > > 爲 > > ūi > > 舟， > > tsiu > > 乞 涸 木 爲 舟， > > kih kok bo̍k ūi tsiu > > 砰 > > pin > > 嘭 > > pong > > 水 > > tsúi > > 中 > > tiong > > 流， > > lâu > > 砰 嘭 水 中 流， > > pin pong tsúi tiong lâu > > 門雙 > > mn̂g-siang > > 劃槳， > > u̍ih-hiúnn > > 門雙 劃槳， > > mn̂g-siang u̍ih-hiúnn > > 噝 > > si > > 刷 > > suit > > 到 > > kàu > > 泉州。 > > tsuân-tsiu > > 噝 刷 到 泉州。 > > si suit kàu tsuân-tsiu An example of a folk love ballad is \"雪梅思君\" (*Suat-m̂-su-kun*) (\"Snow and plum thinking of a gentlemen\"), on the loyalty and chastity of love. An example of love poetry is \"針線情\" (*tsiam-suànn-tsiânn*） (\"The emotions of needle and thread\"): > 你 > > lí > > 是 > > sī > > 針， > > tsiam, > > 我 > > guá > > 是 > > sī > > 線， > > suànn, > > 針線 > > tsiam-suànn > > 永遠 > > éng-uán > > 黏 > > liâm > > 相 > > siòng > > 倚。 > > uá > > 你 是 針， 我 是 線， 針線 永遠 黏 相 倚。 > > lí sī tsiam, guá sī suànn, tsiam-suànn éng-uán liâm siòng uá > > 人 > > lâng > > 講 > > kóng > > 針 > > tsiam > > 補 > > póo > > 針 > > tsiam > > 也 > > hiam > > 著 > > tio̍h > > 線， > > suànn, > > 爲何 > > ūi-hô > > 放 > > pàng > > 阮 > > gún > > 咧 > > leh > > 孤單。 > > koo-tuann > > 人 講 針 補 針 也 著 線， 爲何 放 阮 咧 孤單。 > > lâng kóng tsiam póo tsiam hiam tio̍h suànn, ūi-hô pàng gún leh koo-tuann > > 啊！ > > Ah, > > 你 > > lí > > 我 > > guá > > 本 > > pún > > 是 > > sī > > 同 > > tâng > > 被單， > > phuē-tuann, > > 怎樣 > > tsuánn-iūnn > > 來 > > lâi > > 拆散？ > > thiah-suànn > > 啊！ 你 我 本 是 同 被單， 怎樣 來 拆散？ > > Ah, lí guá pún sī tâng phuē-tuann, tsuánn-iūnn lâi thiah-suànn > > 有 > > ū > > 針 > > tsiam > > 無 > > bô > > 爲 > > suànn > > 叫 > > kiò > > 阮 > > gún > > 要 > > ài > > 按怎， > > an-tsuánn, > > 思念 > > su-liām > > 心情 > > sim-tsiânn > > 無帶 > > bô-tè > > 看。 > > khuànn > > 有 針 無 爲 叫 阮 要 按怎， 思念 心情 無帶 看。 > > ū tsiam bô suànn kiò gún ài an-tsuánn, su-liām sim-tsiânn bô-tè khuànn ### Getai Singapore also held [Getai](/wiki/Getai) during traditional Chinese festivals, for instance the [Zhong Yuan Festival](/wiki/Zhong_Yuan_Festival). During the [Getai](/wiki/Getai) event, it is common to speak a number of Chinese varieties, including [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien), [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_Min), and [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese). During the 1960s, Hokkien song was particularly popular. The Singapore Hokkien star Chen Jin Lang (陳金浪) was once the [compere](/wiki/Master_of_ceremonies) and main singer during the Hungry Ghost Festival. His famous song \"10 levels of Hades\" (\"十殿閻君\") was especially popular. ### In opera Early Singaporean Hokkien opera had its origins in [Gaojia](/wiki/Gaojia) opera, which was brought from [Quanzhou](/wiki/Quanzhou) to Singapore during the late 19th century. In 1927, the Taiwanese [Gezai](/wiki/Taiwanese_opera) opera spread to Singapore. Because its lyrics and singing style were easier to understand, it made a great impact on Singapore. Consequently, by the mid 20th century, it had replaced [Gaojia](/wiki/Gaojia) opera to become the mainstream Hokkien opera in Singapore. Currently, Singapore Hokkien opera is performed by two older troupes—Sin Sai Hong Hokkien Opera Troupe (新賽風閩劇團) and Xiao Kee Lin Hokkien Opera Troupe (筱麒麟閩劇團)—and three newer troupes—Sio Gek Leng Hokkien Opera Troupe (筱玉隆閩劇團), Ai Xin Hokkien Opera Troupe (愛心歌仔戲團), and Do Opera [Hokkien] (延戲[福建歌仔戲]), which is the newest. A Singapore Chinese opera school nurtures talents in opera, including Hokkien opera. ### In movies Singaporean movies that heavily use Hokkien began to appear in the late 1990s, notably by dubbing in Hokkien mainstream Chinese movies made in Singapore. Amongst these, local movies such as *[I Not Stupid](/wiki/I_Not_Stupid)*, *[I Not Stupid Too](/wiki/I_Not_Stupid_Too)*, *[Singapore Dreaming](/wiki/Singapore_Dreaming)* and *[Money No Enough](/wiki/Money_No_Enough)* were popular. These movies often reflected the social environment of local Singaporeans. ### In radio Although Singapore radios started to ban Hokkien in the 1980s, [Rediffusion Singapore](/wiki/Rediffusion_Singapore) continued to broadcast in Hokkien and greatly contributed to the culture of Singapore. For instance, the Hokkien story-telling program *Amoy folks story* (*廈語民間故事*), by [Koh Sock May](/wiki/Koh_Sock_May) (許淑梅), was very popular. ### Nanyin [Nanyin](/wiki/Nanguan_music) (Southern Music) first spread to Singapore in 1901. Many immigrants from Quanzhou began to establish various Nanyin organizations. Those which survive include the [Siong Leng Musical Association](/wiki/Siong_Leng_Musical_Association), which was established in 1941. It was responsible for promoting Nanyin, as well as [Liyuan opera](/wiki/Liyuan_opera). In 1977, the then chairman of the association, Ting Ma Cheng (丁馬成), advocated for the ASEAN Nanyin Performance (亞細安南樂大會奏), which helped to revive Nanyin. In addition, in order to educate young people about this performance art, he also published two books on Nanyin and [Liyuan opera](/wiki/Liyuan_opera). Currently, the [Siong Leng Musical Association](/wiki/Siong_Leng_Musical_Association) is led by Ding Honghai (丁宏海), and it continues to promote Nanyin in Singapore. ## Footprints of Pe̍h-ōe-jī There are some letters written in [Pe̍h-ōe-jī](/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB) from early Hokkien migrants in Singapore. An example was provided by the descendant of Tan Book Hak, a cousin of [Tan Kah Kee](/wiki/Tan_Kah_Kee).

Many other place names in Singapore also have origins in Hokkien, often mixed with Malay. For example, [Ang Mo Kio](/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio) \"宏茂橋\" (*Âng-mô͘-kiô*) means \"red-haired man's bridge\", [Toa Payoh](/wiki/Toa_Payoh) \"大巴窯\" (*Tōa Pa-iô*) combines Hokkien \"toa\" meaning big with Malay \"paya\" meaning swamp, and [Tiong Bahru](/wiki/Tiong_Bahru) \"中峇魯\" (*Tiong-bā-ló͘*) comes from Hokkien \"tiong\" meaning cemetery and Malay \"bahru\" meaning new. - Singapore portal - Linguistics portal - [Hoklo people](/wiki/Hoklo_people) - [Hokkien culture](/wiki/Hokkien_culture) - [Hokkien architecture](/wiki/Hokkien_architecture) - [Written Hokkien](/wiki/Written_Hokkien) - [Hokkien media](/wiki/Hokkien_media) - [Holopedia](/wiki/Holopedia) - [Hokkien influence on Singaporean Mandarin](/wiki/Hokkien_influence_on_Singaporean_Mandarin) - [Speak Hokkien Campaign](/wiki/Speak_Hokkien_Campaign) - [Singaporean Mandarin](/wiki/Singaporean_Mandarin) ## Notes ### Cited works - Chua, B.
