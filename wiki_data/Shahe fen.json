It is also read in [Minnan Chinese](/wiki/Min_Nan) as *kóe-tiâu*; it is borrowed into the [homophones](/wiki/Homophone) **kwetiau** in Indonesia, *kuetiau* in [Malaysian](/wiki/Malaysian_language), and *kway teow* in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore).[*citation needed*] It is also called **kuaitiao** or guay tiew (ก๋วยเตี๋ยว) in Thailand.[*citation needed*] ### Differences [Minnan people](/wiki/Minnan_people) generally consider *shahe fen* and *kway teow* to be two distinct foods, and continue to make a distinction between *shahe fen* and *guotiao/kway teow* in their speech. *Hor fun* was developed by the Cantonese and is thin and tapered like strips of tape, with some porous areas that absorb the gravy, taste, and flavour of the broth or sauce that it is cooked in because it contains less starchy content, which has been stripped away during the production process. In contrast, *guotiao/kuay teow* is dense, and less absorbent and contains a higher level of starch and is more impermeable to absorbing flavours, and thus has to be soaked for a longer period of time in the dish preparation usually for a day or more, or is soaked in water first for a long time before it is fried as *char kway teow*. The taste, texture, flavour, ingredients, length, thickness, width, style, density are considered very different to many people in China and Asia more broadly, but often people from other regions are not be able to tell the difference immediately. *Guotiao/kway teow* has a different origin from *shahe fen* , from Northeast instead of Central China, and is a modification of the *guo/kway* (rice cake) production process, and originated as the ancient preservation of rice as a starch-filled cake patty (of which Korean rice strips are yet another descendant, as it was brought as a recipe from China to Choseon dynasty when the Emperor of China during the Ming dynasty took the Korean princess as one of his concubines, and this recipe was gifted to the people of Choseon as a betrothal gift to the Korean people).[*citation needed*] In Hokkien (Fujian) of China, this version of *guotiao/kway teow* was then influenced by the Cantonese *shahe fen* from the neighboring province of [Guangdong](/wiki/Guangdong). Cantonese culture from the 17th century onwards was thought of as the dominant culture of civilization and culture, of wealth, excess, and sophistication, so the ancient *guotiao/kway teow* underwent modification to become similar to the standard Cantonese *shahe fen/hor fun*. However, these two versions (*guotiao/kway teow* vs. *shahe fen/hor fun*) were spread to Southeast Asia and the world differently, thus they are presented differently in different dishes. Though some restaurants will make a strong distinction, other, more casual Chinese restaurants may use the two interchangeably. Original ricecakes and its strips (i.e. authentic *guotiao/kway teow*) are stiff in texture, even after cooking, often making them less popular with modern consumers. Another similar noodle is the *mee tai mak* (米苔目) which is like the *hor fun* and the *bee hoon* combined with Milanese pasta. It is also known in [Sabah](/wiki/Sabah) as *da fen* (大粉), means \"wide [vermicelli](/wiki/Vermicelli)\", due to its similarity of colour and texture to [rice vermicelli](/wiki/Rice_vermicelli). ### In other languages Other names that are known include **sen yai** (เส้นใหญ่, lit. 'large rice noodles') in Thailand, **hsan-bya** (ဆန်ပြား, lit. 'flat rice') or **nan-bya** (နန်းပြား, lit. 'flat filigree') in [Myanmar](/wiki/Myanmar), and **[hủ tiếu](/wiki/H%E1%BB%A7_ti%E1%BA%BFu)** or **[pho](/wiki/Pho)** in Vietnam. ## Origin *Shahe fen* is believed to have originated in the town of Shahe ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 沙河; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *Shāhé*; [Jyutping](/wiki/Jyutping): *Saa1 Ho4*), now part of the [Tianhe District](/wiki/Tianhe_District) in the city of [Guangzhou](/wiki/Guangzhou), in the southern Chinese province of [Guangdong](/wiki/Guangdong), whence their name derives. *Shahe fen* is a common component of southern Chinese cuisine, although similar noodles are also prepared and enjoyed in nearby [Southeast Asian](/wiki/Southeast_Asia) nations such as [Cambodia](/wiki/Cuisine_of_Cambodia), [Vietnam](/wiki/Cuisine_of_Vietnam), [Thailand](/wiki/Cuisine_of_Thailand), [Philippines](/wiki/Cuisine_of_Philippines), [Malaysia](/wiki/Cuisine_of_Malaysia), [Indonesia](/wiki/Cuisine_of_Indonesia) and [Singapore](/wiki/Cuisine_of_Singapore), all of which have sizeable Chinese populations.[*citation needed*] ## Types *Shahe fen* noodles are white in color, broad, and somewhat slippery. Their texture is elastic and a bit chewy. They do not freeze or dry well and are thus generally (where available) purchased fresh, in strips or sheets that may be cut to the desired width. Where fresh noodles are not available, they may also be purchased packaged in dried form, in various widths. *Shahe fen* noodles are very similar to Vietnamese *[bánh phở](/wiki/Ph%E1%BB%9F)* noodles, which are likely derived from their Chinese counterpart.[*citation needed*] Although the *phở* noodles used in soups may vary in width, wide *phở* noodles are also common in stir fried dishes. The popular Thai dishes *[phat si-io](/wiki/Phat_si-io)* and [drunken noodles](/wiki/Drunken_noodles) are also made with similar noodles.[*citation needed*] ## Chao fen *Shahe fen* is often [stir-fried](/wiki/Stir_frying) with meat and vegetables in a dish called *chao fen* (炒粉; pinyin: chǎo fěn; jyutping: caau2 fan2). While *chao fen* is a transliteration of Mandarin, ***chow fun*** is the name most often given to the dish in [Chinese restaurants in North America](/wiki/American_Chinese_cuisine) from [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese_language). - Food portal - [Chee cheong fun](/wiki/Chee_cheong_fun) - [Fettuccine](/wiki/Fettuccine) - [Fried noodles](/wiki/Fried_noodles) - [Kuyteav](/wiki/Kuyteav) - [Kwetiau goreng](/wiki/Kwetiau_goreng) - [Phở](/wiki/Ph%E1%BB%9F) - [Rice noodle roll](/wiki/Rice_noodle_roll) - [Rice noodles](/wiki/Rice_noodles) ## Gallery\n",
