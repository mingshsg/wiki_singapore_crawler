It was built in 1921 by Venerable [Zhuan Dao](/wiki/Zhuan_Dao) to propagate Buddhism and provide lodging for monks. It is the largest Mahayana Buddhist temple in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) and in 2006 became the parent organization of the Buddhist College of Singapore. It also operates one of [Singapore's](/wiki/Singapore)'s two private [crematoria](/wiki/Crematoria), alongside Tse Toh Aum Temple (Bright Hill Cremation and Columbarium). ## History The temple was founded between 1920 and 1921 by Venerable Zhuan Dao as the Phor Kark See Temple on land in [Thomson Road](/wiki/Thomson_Road,_Singapore) donated by Tay Woo Seng, a Chinese businessman. It was the first traditional Chinese monastery built in Singapore. Since Phor Kark See Monastery is situated at Kong Meng San (\"Bright Hill\", formerly \"Hai Nan Mountain\"), it has come to be known as \"Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery.\" The original temple consisted of a two-storey building, a shrine room, a visitors' room and living quarters. The Monastery expanded over time as philanthropists, including [Aw Boon Haw](/wiki/Aw_Boon_Haw) and [Aw Boon Par](/wiki/Aw_Boon_Par), donated funds. In 1947, Venerable [Hong Choon](/wiki/Hong_Choon) became the monastery's [Chief Abbot](/wiki/Abbot_(Buddhism)), after the death of Venerable [Zhuan Dao](/wiki/Zhuan_Dao). Under his leadership, the monastery complex expanded from two shrine halls to include the Pagoda of 10,000 Buddhas and prayer halls with a total area as large as ten football fields. He also developed the monastery as a place of practice. In 1983, with a S$5.3 million donation from followers of Venerable Seck Hong Choon, the monastery officially opened Evergreen Bright Hill Home, a non-profit nursing home in Singapore providing care for elderly individuals, regardless of race, language, or religion. Venerable Seck Hong Choon died on 25 December 1990, and Venerable Yen Pei was appointed the Chief Abbot in 1991. Venerable Long Gen succeeded him in 1994, followed by Venerable Sui Kim. On 15 January 2002, the temple announced a Compassion Fund to provide financial assistance to retrenched workers with a last drawn pay of up to S$2,500, and who do not qualify for other aid. On 5 June 2004, Venerable [Kwang Sheng](/wiki/Kwang_Sheng) became the monastery's present abbot. Under Kwang Sheng's leadership, the Dharma Propagation Division was set up to facilitate the study and practice of [Dharma](/wiki/Dharma) for Singaporeans. The Youth Ministry, KMSPKS Youth, was set up to serve as a platform for Singaporean youths seeking to learn about Buddhism and serve society via Buddhist teachings. On 13 September 2006, Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery opened the [Buddhist College of Singapore](/wiki/Buddhist_College_of_Singapore). As the country's first Buddhist college, it offers a four-year bachelor's degree in Buddhism. Lessons were held on temple grounds until a new S$35 million five-storey building was completed. In May 2007, Kwang Sheng released a musical album titled *Buddha Smiles*. In October 2007, the temple was one of seven religious groups ordered by the Commissioner of Charities (COC) to open their books to auditors. With an annual income of [S$](/wiki/Singapore_dollar)14.95 million, it had one of the largest incomes among the charities under the COC's direct purview. Its main income sources were [crematorium](/wiki/Crematorium) and [columbarium](/wiki/Columbarium) services, prayer services, and [donations](/wiki/Donation). Between November 2007 and June 2008, the monastery reportedly gave roughly 200 people free meals daily, clarifying their prayer and meditation practices. On 21 June 2008, the temple raised over [S$](/wiki/Singapore_dollar)1 million for the reconstruction of schools devastated in the 12 May Sichuan earthquake, by organizing the Great Compassion; Great Aspiration Charity Show. In April 2009, the temple launched *Gum*, an English-language magazine, to bridge the gap between their older [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien)-speaking devotees and English-speaking youth. The magazine title is a transliteration of a Hokkien term meaning \"to get along\" and symbolizes unity within the congregation. In March 2009, local filmmaker Royston Tan established a new production house, Chuan Pictures, to collaborate with the temple on a 15-minute Mandarin short film, \"Little Note.\" It premiered in September 2009 and focuses on a single mother who gave her son inspirational notes. In December 2014, KMSPKS Youth led their first overseas humanitarian mission into [Chiang Mai](/wiki/Chiang_Mai), [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand). ## Monastery facilities The monastery premises contain [stupas](/wiki/Stupa), prayer halls, a [crematorium](/wiki/Crematorium) and [columbarium](/wiki/Columbarium) which houses over 200,000 [niches](/wiki/Niche_(architecture)), bell and drum towers, and an outdoor statue of [Guanyin](/wiki/Guanyin) ([Avalokiteśvara](/wiki/Avalokite%C5%9Bvara)) that stands between the Dharma Hall and the Pagoda of 10,000 Buddhas. The Hong Choon Memorial Hall of the temple was built in 2004. Another notable feature of the monastery is a [Bodhi tree](/wiki/Bodhi_tree), a sapling brought from the sacred Bodhi tree at [Anuradhapura](/wiki/Anuradhapura), [Sri Lanka](/wiki/Sri_Lanka). This tree at Anuradhapura was brought as a sapling from the sacred Bodhi tree of [Bodh Gaya](/wiki/Bodh_Gaya), [India](/wiki/India), where [Shakyamuni](/wiki/Shakyamuni) [Buddha](/wiki/Buddha) was said to have attained enlightenment. The large [bronze](/wiki/Bronze) [Buddha statue](/wiki/Buddharupa) located in the temple's Hall of No Form is one of Asia's largest Buddha statues, with a height of 13.8 meters and weighing 55 [tons](/wiki/Ton). In 2014, a S$12 million four-story [carpark](/wiki/Carpark) with about 200 spaces was added. A new four-storey, S$1 million eco-friendly burner was installed in 2014 to improve air quality problems during [Qingming Festival](/wiki/Qingming_Festival). ## Buddhist College of Singapore Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery opened the Buddhist College of Singapore on 13 September 2006. As the country's Buddhist college, it offers a four-year bachelor's degree in [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism). The building was supposed to be completed in 2015, but was delayed due to poor weather and manpower issues. Lessons were held on temple grounds until the $35 million five-storey building was completed in 2016 and opened by Prime Minister [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) on 10 September 2016. In 2014, the college announced intentions of accepting female monastics, with the new [nunnery](/wiki/Nun) campus housed at [Poh Ern Shih Temple](/wiki/Poh_Ern_Shih_Temple), taking in 45 students every two years. ## Events The monastery celebrates [Vesak Day](/wiki/Vesak_Day) annually with ceremonies such as \"Bathing the Buddha\" and \"Three-Steps-One-Bow\". Other major events include the [Qingming Festival](/wiki/Qingming_Festival). - [Buddhism in Singapore](/wiki/Buddhism_in_Singapore) - [List of Buddhist temples](/wiki/List_of_Buddhist_temples) - [Kek Lok Si](/wiki/Kek_Lok_Si) - Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery on [Facebook](/wiki/Facebook_(identifier)) - Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery's channel on [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube_user_(identifier))\n",
