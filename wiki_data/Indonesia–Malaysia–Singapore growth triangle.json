  "content": "Growth triangle between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore The SIJORI was established in 1994 between three countries, [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), to strengthen economic links in the region and optimise the complementarity between the three countries. It started off as the **SIJORI Growth Triangle** in 1989, which includes **Si**ngapore, [**Jo**hor](/wiki/Johor) (Malaysia), and [**Ri**au Archipelago](/wiki/Riau_Archipelago), a part of [Riau Islands Province](/wiki/Riau_Islands) (Indonesia). ## History The **SIJORI Growth Triangle** is a partnership arrangement between Singapore, Johor (in Malaysia), and Riau Islands (in Indonesia) that combines the competitive strengths of the three areas to make the subregion more attractive to regional and international investors. More specifically, it links the infrastructure, capital, and expertise of Singapore with the natural and labour resources and the abundance of land of Johor and Riau. The SIJORI Growth Triangle was first publicly announced in 1989 by Singapore Deputy Prime Minister [Goh Chok Tong](/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong). The 'triangle of growth' was envisioned to be a key component of the Singapore regionalisation scheme of the 1980s and 1990s, relocating labour-intensive industries to neighbouring places such as the Malaysian state of Johor (known as the [Iskandar Development Region](/wiki/Iskandar_Development_Region)) and the island of [Batam](/wiki/Batam) in the nearby Indonesian province of [Riau](/wiki/Riau) (at the time, before splitting off as a part of Riau Islands province in 2004). As more Malaysian and Indonesian states joined the grouping, the IMS-GT was formed to formalise the new grouping. A [Memorandum of Understanding](/wiki/Memorandum_of_Understanding) (MOU) was signed on 17 December 1994 by the representatives of the participating countries; Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong), Malaysia' s International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Seri [Rafidah Aziz](/wiki/Rafidah_Aziz) and Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Trade and Industry Hartono. ## Statistics Batam is a tax free *export zone* rather than a [free port](/wiki/Free_port), therefore much industry is limited to international exports. Batam has also become an alternate air transport hub as Java's airports are congested. Some 62,000 Singaporeans visited Batam in January 2012, compared with stronger links to Johor, some 70,000 daily.
