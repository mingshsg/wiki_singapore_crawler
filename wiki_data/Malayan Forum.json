It played a significant role in shaping the modern political trajectories of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) and [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia). The forum was motivated by concerns over continued [British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire) rule in the region. Although it was not an actual political party and its members held diverse ideological viewpoints, they were united by a common anti-colonial stance. Among its founders were [Abdul Razak Hussein](/wiki/Abdul_Razak_Hussein), who later became the [Prime Minister of Malaysia](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Malaysia); [Goh Keng Swee](/wiki/Goh_Keng_Swee), recognised as a founding father of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore); and Maurice Baker, who went on to serve as Singapore's ambassador to India, Nepal, Malaysia and the Philippines. The Malayan Forum is often regarded as an informal predecessor to Singapore's [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) and, indirectly, to Malaysia's [Democratic Action Party](/wiki/Democratic_Action_Party) (DAP), particularly following the [separation of Singapore from Malaysia](/wiki/Independence_of_Singapore_Agreement_1965) when the Malayan remnants of the PAP contributed to the formation of the DAP.
