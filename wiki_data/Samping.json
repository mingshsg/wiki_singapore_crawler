  "content": "Malay traditional clothing **Samping** or **Kain Dagang** ([Jawi](/wiki/Jawi_script): سمڤيڠ) is a traditional [Malay](/wiki/Malays_(ethnic_group)) costume originated from the court of [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca), and is traditionally worn by men and women in [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) and southern [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand). This type of traditional costume is a part of the [national dress](/wiki/National_dress) of [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei) and [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia). ## Etymology *Samping* or *Kain Dagang* is loosely translated as \"side\" or \"merchant cloth\" as it is worn mostly during formal occasions. It is a kind of short [sarong](/wiki/Sarong) worn after wearing *[Baju Kurung](/wiki/Baju_Kurung)* or *[Baju Melayu](/wiki/Baju_Melayu)* (in Malay costume) and usually from the waist to the knees only. It is usually made of [songket](/wiki/Songket), [tenun](/wiki/Tenun_Pahang_Diraja), or [sarong](/wiki/Sarong) fabric. ## Styles *Samping* wear styles vary by state. For example, the style of *Berdagang Dalam* is very popular in the Malaysian state of Johor. It is usually worn with a style of *[Baju Melayu](/wiki/Baju_Melayu)* called *Teluk Belanga*. For other states in Malaysia, particularly on the west coast of the Malay peninsula, the style of *Berdagang Luar* is the most prominent, and usually worn with a style of *[Baju Melayu](/wiki/Baju_Melayu)* called *Cekak Musang*. For women, instead of wearing *samping*, it is usually held by the left hand and can be used as a veil when outdoor to protect oneself from the scorching sun. The way in which *Samping* was worn in ancient times played a role in showing the difference in one's rank in society. At that time, only the royal family could wear the *Samping* with the *Berdagang Luar* style. However now, everyone is free to choose how to wear a *samping* according to their tastes. When indoor, it can be tied at the waist or hung on the arm. The style of *samping* can be divided into three according to one's rank in society namely: - Ikatan Pancung (kings, sultans, and princes) - Ikatan Kembung (Malay nobleman) - Ikatan Lingkup (common people) - Clothing portal - Fashion portal - Malaysia portal - [Malaysian cultural outfits](/wiki/Malaysian_cultural_outfits) - [Culture of Malaysia](/wiki/Culture_of_Malaysia) ### Cited texts\n",
