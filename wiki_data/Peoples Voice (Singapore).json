  "content": "Singaporean political party **Peoples Voice** (**PV**) is a [political party](/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Singapore) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). PV was founded in 2018 by [Lim Tean](/wiki/Lim_Tean) after he left [National Solidarity Party](/wiki/National_Solidarity_Party_(Singapore)) (NSP) in 2017. ## History In 2017, [Lim Tean](/wiki/Lim_Tean) stepped down from his secretary-general position in NSP and left the party, citing fundamental differences with their approach to politics. He then founded PV which was officially registered on 31 October 2018 with the Registry of Societies. In March 2019, Leong Sze Hian was made the PV's [shadow finance minister](/wiki/Shadow_minister) while Kok Ming Cheang was made the shadow health minister. In the [2020 general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election), which was called on 23 June with the dissolution of the [13th Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/13th_Parliament_of_Singapore), PV had put forward 10 candidates to contest [Mountbatten SMC](/wiki/Mountbatten_Single_Member_Constituency), [Jalan Besar GRC](/wiki/Jalan_Besar_Group_Representation_Constituency), and [Pasir-Ris Punggol GRC](/wiki/Pasir_Ris%E2%80%93Punggol_GRC), the latter of which was also the battleground for a three-cornered contest including the [Singapore Democratic Alliance](/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Alliance). Following the election on 10 July, the party won none of the contested seats. Their five-member team for [Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC](/wiki/Pasir_Ris%E2%80%93Punggol_GRC) team had also lost a combined $67,500 [election deposit](/wiki/Election_deposit) (five times the deposit of $13,500 per candidate) for garnering only 12.18% of the votes, falling just 0.32% short of the one-eighth threshold (12.5%) in order to keep their deposit. In terms of vote share, they got 21.26% of the votes cast on all the constituencies contested, and 2.37% based on overall popular vote. In June 2023, PV leader Lim Tean announced the formation of the [People's Alliance for Reform](/wiki/People%27s_Alliance_for_Reform) with three other opposition parties: [Reform Party](/wiki/Reform_Party_(Singapore)), [People's Power Party](/wiki/People%27s_Power_Party_(Singapore)) and the [Democratic Progressive Party](/wiki/Democratic_Progressive_Party_(Singapore)). PV will contest in the [2025 Singaporean general election](/wiki/2025_Singaporean_general_election) under the alliance's banner. ## Leadership NoLeaderYears1[Lim Tean](/wiki/Lim_Tean)2020–present ## Electoral performance ElectionLeaderVotes%SeatsNCMPsPositionResultContestedTotal+/–SeatsWonLost(/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election)[Lim Tean](/wiki/Lim_Tean)59,1832.37%100100 / 930 / 2 6thNo seats - [Elections in Singapore](/wiki/Elections_in_Singapore) - [List of political parties in Singapore](/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Singapore) - [Politics of Singapore](/wiki/Politics_of_Singapore) - Official website[*dead link*]\n",
