  "content": "The **MAS Electronic Payment System**, or **MEPS** in short, is an [SGD](/wiki/Singapore_Dollar)-only online [interbank](/wiki/Interbank_network) payment and fund transfer system in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It went online in July 1998, and is owned and operated by the [Monetary Authority of Singapore](/wiki/Monetary_Authority_of_Singapore) (MAS). The irrevocable transfer of funds and the real-time nature of transfers are some of the key features of MEPS. As of 9 December 2006, the system was upgraded to **MEPS+**, which includes improved features such as the use of [SWIFT](/wiki/Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication) message formats and network and automated gridlock detection and resolution. - [Banking in Singapore](/wiki/Banking_in_Singapore) This Singaporean organisation article is a stub.
