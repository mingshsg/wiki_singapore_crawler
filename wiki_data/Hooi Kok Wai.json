  "content": "Singaporean chef and restaurateur **Hooi Kok Wai** ([simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 许国威; [traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 許國威; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *Xǔ Guówēi*; born c. 1939), also known as **Hooi Kok Wah**, is a Singaporean chef and restaurateur. Known as one of the country's four \"heavenly kings\" of cooking, he began his cooking career in the 1950s. ## Career Hooi started working as a cook at the Cathay Restaurant in the 1950s. On 8 April 1963, Hooi opened his own restaurant, the Dragon Phoenix Restaurant in [Tanjong Pagar](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar). In 1974, the Red Star Restaurant, a joint venture between Hooi and his former colleagues at the Cathay Restaurant, was opened. Hooi is credited with creating a distinct version of [chilli crab](/wiki/Chilli_crab) that involves eggs, [sambal](/wiki/Sambal), and tomato paste. Hooi and his Red Star Restaurant co-founders, collectively known as the four \"heavenly kings\" of cooking in Singapore, are also credited with popularising a [Chinese New Year](/wiki/Chinese_New_Year) raw fish salad known as *[yusheng](/wiki/Yusheng)* and inventing the [yam ring](/wiki/Yam_ring). As of 2018, Hooi was still involved in running the Red Star Restaurant, while he had handed over management of the Dragon Phoenix Restaurant to his son.
