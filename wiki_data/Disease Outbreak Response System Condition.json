The system is colour-coded reflecting the disease situation in Singapore. Beside showing the disease situation, it also outline the impact on the general public and what the general public should do. ## History In 2003, after the [SARS](/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome) outbreak in Singapore, the [Ministry of Health](/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Singapore)) created the National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan which included DORSCON. DORSCON was first used during the [2009 swine flu pandemic in Singapore](/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic_in_Asia#Singapore). The plan was further updated after the swine flu pandemic is over. In 2013, then-Health Minister [Gan Kim Yong](/wiki/Gan_Kim_Yong) announced a revised DORSCON framework. The framework now considers disease severity in addition to the spread of diseases in Singapore, thereby indicating the overall public health impact in Singapore. In addition to that, control measures are no longer hard-wired to each phase but are modular for MOH's continually assessment of the risks, hence making the framework more flexible with four colour alerts instead of five. This allows the framework to be used for both mild and severe diseases. In 2023, Health Minister [Ong Ye Kung](/wiki/Ong_Ye_Kung) announced plans to replace the colour-coded DORSCON framework with a 4-tiered public health situational framework. ## DORSCON levels LevelNature of DiseaseDiseaseImpact on Daily LifeAdvice to PublicGreenDisease is mild or disease is severe but does not spread easily from person to person.[MERS](/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome), [H7N9](/wiki/H7N9)Minimal disruption, e.g. border screening, travel advice. - Be socially responsible: if you are sick, stay home - Maintain good personal hygiene - Look out for health advisories YellowDisease is severe and spreads easily from person to person but is occurring outside Singapore or disease is spreading in Singapore but is typically mild, i.e. only slightly more severe than seasonal influenza.
