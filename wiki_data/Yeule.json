  "content": "Singaporean music projectMusical artist **Yeule** (/ˈjuːl/ *YOOL*; stylised in [lower case](/wiki/Lower_case)) is the musical project of **Nat Ćmiel**,[a] a [Singaporean](/wiki/Singaporean) songwriter and producer. Starting in 2012, they incorporate elements of [ambient](/wiki/Ambient_music), [glitch](/wiki/Glitch_music) and Asian post-pop. Their name is derived from *[Final Fantasy](/wiki/Final_Fantasy)* character [Paddra Nsu-Yeul](/wiki/Characters_of_the_Final_Fantasy_XIII_series#Paddra_Nsu-Yeul). ## Early life and education Nat Ćmiel was born in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) where they attended school. They first started playing music at the age of 6 on their parents' [Yamaha](/wiki/Yamaha_Corporation) piano and learned [classically](/wiki/Classically_trained) although eventually dropped taking lessons, and wanted to explore something more challenging which led them to guitar and drums. Ćmiel initially started playing [waltz](/wiki/Waltz) pieces, though they soon moved on to songs from the soundtracks of [Final Fantasy X](/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X) and [Kingdom Hearts](/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts). They later went on to sing in a jazz band under the name Riot Diet, covering songs from [Ella Fitzgerald](/wiki/Ella_Fitzgerald) and the [Pixies](/wiki/Pixies_(band)). Growing up, feelings of loneliness and depression were present due in part to Ćmiel's [nomadic](/wiki/Nomadic) upbringing. They found solace on the internet, which would influence their later works. After graduating from high school, they applied to [Central Saint Martins](/wiki/Central_Saint_Martins) to study fashion communication and womenswear. Ćmiel graduated from Central Saint Martins in [London](/wiki/London) with a degree in [Fine Arts](/wiki/Fine_Arts) in 2020. ## Musical timeline Ćmiel's first release under the Yeule title was their self-titled [EP](/wiki/Extended_play) on March 3, 2014. Their name was inspired by the *Final Fantasy XIII-2* character [Paddra Nsu-Yeul](/wiki/Characters_of_the_Final_Fantasy_XIII_series#Paddra_Nsu-Yeul), a reincarnating seeress with a fragmented soul; for Ćmiel, the character's \"fate connotes the acceptance of mortality\". On December 11, 2016, Ćmiel released their second EP, *Pathos*, which was dedicated to David Singh. Ćmiel followed up with the [OST](/wiki/Original_soundtrack) to interactive simulator game *Lost Memories Dot Net*, which was released on July 17, 2017. On September 27, 2017, Ćmiel released their third EP, *Coma*. With regard to the writing, they said that \"I wrote this album to commemorate the people I'd lost.\" The EP received a positive reception with Duncan Cooper of The Fader describing it as \"[dream-pop](/wiki/Dream-pop) perfection\". Ćmiel signed to Bayonet Records on July 17, 2019. On October 25, 2019, Ćmiel released their debut studio album *Serotonin II*. On the process of creating the album they said that \"Writing the record, I was dreadful. I didn't ask for much, I don't need to be happy. I just wanted to be content.\" The album received a positive critical reception with Jude Noel of *[Tiny Mix Tapes](/wiki/Tiny_Mix_Tapes)* giving the album 4/5 and saying that \"Melancholia aside, it's Serotonin II's impeccable sound design that has kept me coming back\". Ćmiel teased the release of their second album *[Glitch Princess](/wiki/Glitch_Princess)* via Bayonet Records with a track titled \"My Name is Nat Ćmiel\"—released at the end of 2020. The full album was released on February 4, 2022. It was qualified as \"pioneering\" by Colin Lodewick from *[Pitchfork](/wiki/Pitchfork_(website))* and featured in their 'Best New Music' section with a critical score of 8.3. In between \"My Name Is Nat Ćmiel\" and *Glitch Princess*, Ćmiel released the remix EP *Serotonin X Remixes* and the covers album *Nuclear War Post X*, the latter issued directly through their website as a limited-edition paperback art book with a download for the entire album. Over the first weekend of May 2023, Yeule teased some images on their social media channels mentioning the date of May 10. On that date, Yeule premiered the video and released the single for their new song \"Sulky Baby\" and announced that they had signed to the [Ninja Tune](/wiki/Ninja_Tune) label. They told *[Rolling Stone](/wiki/Rolling_Stone)*, \"The creative trajectory is shapeshifting, and Ninja Tune was the most versatile with their views on artistic direction as most of my creative pitches often tend to be fringe in conceptual aspects. I admire the team's work ethic and tastes, and they've also worked with other creatives I know and love to this day, it feels nice to be with them!\" \"Sulky Baby\" was included on their third album, *[Softscars](/wiki/Softscars)*, which was released on September 22, 2023 to critical acclaim. During October 2024, Yeule teased a new single, \"Eko\", being released on the 23rd the same month. On February 25, 2025, they released promotional material for a new single and an upcoming album, alongside a release date of March 3. The next day, a new single, \"Skullcrusher\", was officially announced, being produced alongside with [Clams Casino](/wiki/Clams_Casino_(musician)) and FITNESSS. On March 3rd, Yeule announced their fourth studio album, [*Evangelic Girl Is a Gun*](/wiki/Evangelic_Girl_Is_a_Gun), and it was released on May 30, 2025. ## Music style and influences Ćmiel's music has been described as a variety of categories including: \"[electronic](/wiki/Electropop) post-pop\", [avant-pop](/wiki/Avant-pop) and [experimental pop](/wiki/Experimental_pop). *Serotonin II* was labeled as an [ambient](/wiki/Ambient_music) album and received comparisons to [Enya's music](/wiki/Enya_discography) and [Grimes](/wiki/Grimes)' album *[Visions](/wiki/Visions_(Grimes_album))* (2012). *Glitch Princess* is a [glitch pop](/wiki/Glitch_pop) album with influences of [emo pop](/wiki/Emo_pop), [spoken word](/wiki/Spoken_word) and ambient music.
