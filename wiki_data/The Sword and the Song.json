The drama focuses on a pair of great monarchs during the 10th century: [Song dynasty](/wiki/Song_dynasty)'s fearless and heroic warrior [Zhao Kuangyin](/wiki/Emperor_Taizu_of_Song) and [Southern Tang](/wiki/Southern_Tang)'s compassionate and sentimental poet-artist [Li Yu](/wiki/Li_Yu_(Southern_Tang)), and how their vastly different personalities sealed the fates of their respective countries. The stories about Zhao Kuangyin are to some extent based on Wu Xuan's 1768 Chinese novel *Fei Long Quan Zhuan* (飛龍全傳). Two subsequent TV series, the 1996 Taiwanese drama *Love, Sword, Mountain & River* and the 2005 Chinese drama *[How Much Sorrow Do You Have](/wiki/How_Much_Sorrow_Do_You_Have)* feature virtually the same main characters, though the plots differ somewhat. ## Cast and characters ### Northern China ([Later Han](/wiki/Later_Han_(Five_Dynasties)), [Later Zhou](/wiki/Later_Zhou), [Song dynasty](/wiki/Song_dynasty)) - Lin Mingzhe as [Zhao Kuangyin](/wiki/Emperor_Taizu_of_Song) - [Chen Tianwen](/wiki/Chen_Tianwen) as [Zhao Kuangyi](/wiki/Emperor_Taizong_of_Song), Zhao Kuangyin's younger brother - Chen Tianxiang as [Zhao Hongyin](/wiki/Zhao_Hongyin), Zhao Kuangyi's father - Chen Juanjuan as [Du Siniang](/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Du), Zhao Kuangyi's mother - Liu Qianyi as [Liu Chengyou](/wiki/Liu_Chengyou), Later Han's emperor - Hu Shuzhen as He Jinchan - Yan Bingliang as [Han Tong](/wiki/Han_Tong) - Guo Chongyi as Han Wei, Han Tong's son - Gu Rongfang as [Guo Wei](/wiki/Guo_Wei) - Tang Wentao as [Chai Rong](/wiki/Chai_Rong) - Hong Peixing as [Shi Shouxin](/wiki/Shi_Shouxin) - Lin Jinchi as Wei Yixiao - An Zheming as [Zhao Pu](/wiki/Zhao_Pu) - Ye Shipin as Zheng En - [Hong Huifang](/wiki/Hong_Huifang) as Tao Sanchun ### Southern China ([Southern Tang](/wiki/Southern_Tang), [Chu](/wiki/Chu_(Ten_Kingdoms))) - [Li Wenhai](/wiki/Li_Wenhai_(actor)) as [Li Yu](/wiki/Li_Yu_(Southern_Tang)) - Zheng Wanling as Zhou Huimin (NvYing) - Wu Weiqiang as [Li Jing](/wiki/Li_Jing_(Southern_Tang)), Li Yu's father and Southern Tang's emperor - Zhu Yuye as [Empress Zhong](/wiki/Empress_Zhong), Li Yu's mother - [Chen Xiuhuan](/wiki/Chen_Xiuhuan) as [Zhou Ehuang](/wiki/Queen_Zhou_the_Elder) - Yang Junhe as [Li Jingsui](/wiki/Li_Jingsui), Li Yu's uncle - [Huang Shinan](/wiki/Huang_Shinan_(Actor)) as [Li Hongji](/wiki/Li_Hongji), Li Yu's older brother - Jin Jugong as Li Congshan, Li Yu's younger brother - Liu Qiulian as Huang Feng - [Michelle Chia](/wiki/Michelle_Chia) as Huang Feng (child) - Fu Shuiyu as Liuzhu - Zeng Yaofeng as Huangfu Jixun - Opening on [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube) This Singaporean television-related article is a stub.
