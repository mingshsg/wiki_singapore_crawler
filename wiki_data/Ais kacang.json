  "content": "Malaysian dessert ***Ais kacang*** (Malay pronunciation: [aɪs ˈkatʃaŋ]; [Jawi](/wiki/Jawi_script): ‏اءيس كاچڠ‎), literally meaning \"bean ice\", also commonly known as **ABC** (acronym for ***air batu campur*** ([air ˈbatu tʃamˈpʊr]), Jawi: اءير باتو چمڤور, meaning \"mixed ice\"), is a dessert which is common in [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) (where it is called **ice *kachang***) and [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei). Traditionally, an ice shaving machine is used to churn out the [shaved ice](/wiki/Shaved_ice) used in the dessert, originally hand cranked but now more often motorised. Many [Southeast Asian](/wiki/Southeast_Asia) coffee shops, [hawker centres](/wiki/Hawker_centre) and [food courts](/wiki/Food_court) sell this dessert. ## History Early versions of ais kacang was first known to have been prepared around the time before and after the [First World War](/wiki/First_World_War), where the costs of ice manufacturing was becoming more affordable. An earlier variant of the Singaporean dish was described as green, made from shaved ice, paired with syrups, *soaked seeds* and seaweed jelly and was sold mainly by street vendors. The dish underwent many different alterations and variants throughout the history of Singapore, where during the 1920s, one version of it was described as shaved ice topped with rose water, lime or liquorice. A version of the dish, known as Kachang mera, was also sold during the 1930s. By the 1940s, the version of the dish described as having \"shaved ice heaped into a little mountain\", topped with [red beans](/wiki/Adzuki_bean), \"a Chinese grape-like fruit\", syrup, and [condensed](/wiki/Condensed_milk) or [evaporated milk](/wiki/Evaporated_milk), similar to how it is being prepared today, began to appear. Some earlier variants of ais kacang are no longer sold, such as the ice ball version of the dessert, which was popular during the 1950s and 1960s. ## Preparation *Ais kacang* was originally made of only shaved ice and red beans, though the number and diversity of ingredients has since expanded. Today, *ais kacang* generally comes in bright colors and with various fruit cocktails and dressings. In Malaysia, variants now contain a large serving of *[attap chee](/wiki/Nypa_fruticans#Food_and_beverages)* (palm seed), red beans, [sweet corn](/wiki/Sweet_corn), [grass jelly](/wiki/Grass_jelly), roasted [peanuts](/wiki/Peanut), and cubes of [agar agar](/wiki/Agar_agar) as common ingredients. Other less common ingredients include [aloe vera](/wiki/Aloe_vera), *[cendol](/wiki/Cendol)*, *[nata de coco](/wiki/Nata_de_coco)*, and [ice cream](/wiki/Ice_cream). A final topping of evaporated milk, condensed milk, or coconut milk is drizzled over the mountain of ice along with red [rose syrup](/wiki/Rose_water) and [sarsi](/wiki/Sarsaparilla_(soft_drink)) syrup. Some stalls have even introduced novelty toppings such as [durian](/wiki/Durian) and [chocolate syrup](/wiki/Chocolate_syrup). There are also versions that shun the multi-coloured syrup and are served instead with just a drizzling of [palm sugar](/wiki/Palm_sugar) syrup. In Singapore, traditional ice kachang is usually made from shaved ice, packed into a mountain-like shape and consists of red beans, creamed corn, attap chee, cendol, and grass jelly, similar to the Malaysian version, and drizzled with syrups made from [gula melaka](/wiki/Gula_melaka), red rose syrup, and [pandan](/wiki/Pandanus_amaryllifolius) syrup. The dish has evolved to include fruits such as durian, mango, toppings such as [Milo](/wiki/Milo_(chocolate_bar)), peanuts, and [sago pearls](/wiki/Sago) among others.
