Please help improve this article by introducing more precise citations. *(May 2013)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* ***Remember Chek Jawa*** is a 47-minute [documentary](/wiki/Documentary_film) made on [digital video](/wiki/Digital_video) by freelance [cinematographer](/wiki/Cinematography) Eric Lin Youwei. It documents a biodiversity survey conducted in 2001, by a small group of volunteer [conservationists](/wiki/Conservation_movement), headed by botanist Joseph Lai, months before the [Singapore government](/wiki/Singapore_government)'s reclamation project at [Chek Jawa](/wiki/Chek_Jawa), [Pulau Ubin](/wiki/Pulau_Ubin). Chek Jawa is an inter-tidal area of about 1 square kilometre which supports a vast amount of plant and animal lives encompassing six [ecosystems](/wiki/Ecosystem). The volunteers' efforts were rewarded when the government agreed, in December 2001, to defer use of the Chek Jawa land for the next ten years. The documentary is available as a [DVD](/wiki/DVD) under Objectifs Films, available in the libraries under the [National Library Board](/wiki/National_Library_Board), Singapore. - *Remember Chek Jawa* at [IMDb](/wiki/IMDb_(identifier)) This article about a documentary film on environmental issues is a stub.
