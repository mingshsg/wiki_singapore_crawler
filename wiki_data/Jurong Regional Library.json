  "content": "Regional library in Singapore **Jurong Regional Library** ([Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese): 裕廊区域图书馆; [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language): *Perpustakaan Wilayah Jurong*) is a [public library](/wiki/Public_library) located in [Jurong East](/wiki/Jurong_East), Singapore. It is located next to the now defunct [JCube](/wiki/JCube) and is within walking distances of [Jurong East Bus Interchange](/wiki/Jurong_East_Bus_Interchange) and [Jurong East MRT station](/wiki/Jurong_East_MRT_station). It is the third regional library to be completed after the [Tampines](/wiki/Tampines_Regional_Library) and [Woodlands regional libraries](/wiki/Woodlands_Regional_Library). During the construction of the [National Library building](/wiki/National_Library,_Singapore), it temporarily housed the main collections of the reference library until the opening of the new building on 22 July 2005. ## History The library was first opened on 1 August 1988 as Jurong East Community Library by Ho Kah Leong who was the Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Communications & Information) and Member of Parliament for Jurong Constituency. It was subsequently closed in June 2003 for upgrading works. After the completion of its refurbishment in 2004, it was re-opened as Jurong Regional Library on 4 June that year by the then Acting Minister for Education, [Tharman Shanmugaratnam](/wiki/Tharman_Shanmugaratnam). ### Future relocation The Urban Redevelopment Authority and National Library Board announced on 15 November 2022 that the library would be relocated to the future [Jurong East Integrated Transport Hub](/wiki/Jurong_East_MRT_station) in 2028. ## Notes - Jurong Regional Library 01°19′57.69″N 103°44′22.47″E﻿ / ﻿1.3326917°N 103.7395750°E﻿ / 1.3326917; 103.7395750 This article about a Singapore building or structure is a stub.
