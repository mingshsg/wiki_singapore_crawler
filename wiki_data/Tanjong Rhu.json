The perimeter of Tanjong Rhu is made up of [Nicoll Highway](/wiki/Nicoll_Highway) in the north; Mountbatten Road and Fort Road in the east; [East Coast Parkway](/wiki/East_Coast_Parkway) (ECP) in the south; as well as [Marina Channel](/wiki/Marina_Channel) and [Kallang Basin](/wiki/Kallang_Basin) in the west. Tanjong Rhu is the largest in terms of physical area among the nine subzones that make up Kallang. Consisting of residential, commercial and recreational developments, Tanjong Rhu is famous for being the location of the [Singapore Sports Hub](/wiki/Singapore_Sports_Hub), which includes the [Kallang Wave Mall](/wiki/Kallang_Wave_Mall), [new National Stadium](/wiki/National_Stadium,_Singapore) and the [Singapore Indoor Stadium](/wiki/Singapore_Indoor_Stadium). Previously, the [old National Stadium](/wiki/Former_National_Stadium,_Singapore) which hosted a total of 18 [National Day Parades](/wiki/Singapore_National_Day_Parade) sat on the land now occupied by the new National Stadium. The former [Kallang Airport](/wiki/Kallang_Airport) once extended into this area, with part of its old runway being the modern-day Stadium Boulevard. Other sports facilities in Tanjong Rhu include the [Kallang Tennis Centre](/wiki/Kallang_Tennis_Centre), [Kallang Field](/wiki/Kallang_Field), [Kallang Ground](/wiki/Kallang_Ground), Kallang Track, Kallang Netball Centre, Kallang Squash Centre and PAssion WaVe @ Marina Bay. Notable places include [Kallang Theatre](/wiki/Kallang_Theatre), [Leisure Park Kallang](/wiki/Leisure_Park_Kallang), Mountbatten Fire Post, Katong Community Centre, Singapore Swimming Club, the [Benjamin Sheares Bridge](/wiki/Benjamin_Sheares_Bridge) and [Dunman High School](/wiki/Dunman_High_School), one of Singapore's leading educational institutions. Tanjong Rhu is also a residential neighbourhood, made up of mostly condominiums and private housing along Tanjong Rhu Road. A few blocks of public housing built by the [Housing and Development Board](/wiki/Housing_and_Development_Board) (HDB) exist along Kampong Arang Road and Kampong Kayu Road. These residential estates are connected to the Singapore Sports Hub via Stadium Way, across the [Geylang River](/wiki/Geylang_River). ## Etymology The name *Tanjong Rhu* appeared in [Manuel Godinho de Erédia](/wiki/Manuel_Godinho_de_Er%C3%A9dia)'s 1604 map of Singapore spelt as *Tanjon Rû*, it means \"casuarina cape\" in [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) from the trees of *[Casuarina equisetifolia](/wiki/Casuarina_equisetifolia)* or almost similar *C. littoria* (*ru* or *rhu*) species that grew along the beach between [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang) and [Rochor](/wiki/Rochor). It was known as *sha tsui* (沙咀) in [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese), which means \"[sand spit](/wiki/Sand_spit)\". ## History Tanjong Rhu has been associated with [ship building](/wiki/Ship_building) and repairing from the early days. Captain William Flint, a [harbour master](/wiki/Harbour_master), started a [boat building](/wiki/Boat_building) and repair company here in 1822. Thomas Tivendale had his (Wilkinson, Tivendale and Company) [shipyard](/wiki/Shipyard) here in the 1860s. The shipyard would be acquired by [John I. Thornycroft & Company](/wiki/John_I._Thornycroft_%26_Company) in 1926 and close in 1986 by successor [Vosper Thornycroft](/wiki/Vosper_Thornycroft) Pte Singapore. As late as the 1980s and the early 1990s, the Tanjong Rhu area was an [industrial](/wiki/Industrial_region) area with shipyards. The water surrounding Tanjong Rhu was [polluted](/wiki/Water_pollution) with industrial and domestic [waste](/wiki/Waste), creating an extremely unpleasant environment. A massive relocation exercise was then undertaken by the [Singapore Government](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore) to transform Tanjong Rhu into a high-end residential area. [Reclamation of land](/wiki/Land_reclamation) along the Tanjong Rhu coast began as early as 1992. Private developers then started the new luxury residential developments in Tanjong Rhu. Today, the shipyards have since been relocated elsewhere and [condominiums](/wiki/Condominium_(living_space)) have replaced them. In September 1993, 12 men were arrested in an entrapment operation in Tanjong Rhu coined the \"Fort Road Incident\". The operation, which targeted homosexual men, led to charges of \"outrage of modesty\". Six of the men pleaded guilty and were sentenced to three strokes of the cane each and imprisonment ranging from two to six months. The names, ages and occupations of all 12 men were published in all major Singaporean newspapers. The operation has been noted for its controversial nature due to its entrapment tactics and harsh punishment of homosexual individuals. Those were the last reported cases of such police entrapment. A short 19-minute 2009 film, \"The Casuarina Cove\" by [Boo Junfeng](/wiki/Boo_Junfeng) told the story of one of those men. ## Residential developments ### HDBs Years BuiltProject NameStreetBlocks1984Di Tanjong RhuKampong Kayu Road11969–1970Jalan Batu2-91986Jalan Batu10-112029Tanjong Rhu Riverfront ISampan Place24-252029Tanjong Rhu Riverfront IIKampong Arang Road26-28 ### Condominiums - Costa Rhu - Pebble Bay - Fort Gardens - Water Place - Sanctuary Green - Parkshore - Tanjong Ria - Camelot By The Water - Casuarina Cove - The Waterside - The Line @ Tanjong Rhu - Fulcrum - Crystal Rhu - La Ville ## Public transport ### Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Tanjong Rhu is served by four [MRT](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) stations, spread across two lines, namely the [Circle Line](/wiki/Circle_Line_(Singapore)) and the [Thomson–East Coast line](/wiki/Thomson%E2%80%93East_Coast_MRT_Line).
