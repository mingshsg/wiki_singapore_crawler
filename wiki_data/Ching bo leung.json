'refreshing, nourishing, cool') is a sweet, cold dessert soup of [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_cuisine) origin, which is commonly served in [Cantonese cuisine](/wiki/Cantonese_cuisine), [Hainanese cuisine](/wiki/Hainanese_cuisine) and [Guangxi cuisine](/wiki/Guangxi_cuisine). It is a popular dessert in Malaysia and Singapore. It is a type of *[tong sui](/wiki/Tong_sui)*. In Singapore it is known as **清汤** (\"*Cheng Tng*\" in the [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) dialect). It is known as ***sâm bổ lượng*** or ***chè sâm bổ lượng*** (*[chè](/wiki/Ch%C3%A8)* meaning \"sweet soup\") in Vietnam. Although the exact recipe may vary, the drink generally contains grains of [*yi mai*](/wiki/Coix_lacryma-jobi_var._ma-yuen) (Chinese pearl barley), dried [longans](/wiki/Longan), red [jujubes](/wiki/Jujube), [lotus seeds](/wiki/Lotus_seed), and thinly sliced [seaweed](/wiki/Seaweed#Food), with water, sugar, and [crushed ice](/wiki/Ice_cube). In place of the *yi mai*, [pearl barley](/wiki/Pearl_barley) may sometimes be used, and thinly sliced strips of [ginger](/wiki/Ginger) and/or [ginseng](/wiki/Ginseng) root, [wolfberries](/wiki/Wolfberry), or [ginkgo nuts](/wiki/Ginkgo_nuts) may also appear as ingredients. The Chinese form of the drink, ching bo leung, is the most popular in the [Cantonese cuisine](/wiki/Cantonese_cuisine) of [Guangdong](/wiki/Guangdong), [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong), [Macau](/wiki/Macau). It is also popular as a dessert at food & hawker centres in Malaysia and Singapore. It is sometimes known as [*luk mei* soup](/wiki/Asian_soups#Medicinal) (六味汤, lit. 'six flavour soup'). The Vietnamese version, *sâm bổ lượng*, is most readily available in [Cholon](/wiki/Cholon,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City), the [Chinatown](/wiki/Chinatown) of [Ho Chi Minh City](/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City), and is generally served in a tall glass. Although it is sometimes described as a drink, the term \"soup\" is more appropriate, as a spoon is generally necessary to consume the solid ingredients. In [Hainan](/wiki/Hainan), due to the relative abundance of local [coconuts](/wiki/Coconut), a frequent unique ingredient used to make qing bu liang would be cold [coconut milk](/wiki/Coconut_milk). In this tropical province, a Hainanese qing bu liang could consist of assorted ingredients that can include [mango](/wiki/Mango), [watermelon](/wiki/Watermelon), coconut meat or shredded dried coconut, cooked mung beans, red kidney beans, taro, quail eggs, bean jelly, red jujubes and then combined with brown sugar syrup, ice, coconut water or coconut milk, and sometimes a few scoops of [ice cream](/wiki/Ice_cream). The dish is believed to help \"dispel heat\" from the body and is popular during the typical hot Hainan weather where there are a prolific number of qing bu liang shops and dessert stands in the tropical island province with varying ingredients and flavours. - [Tong sui](/wiki/Tong_sui) - Article about *sâm bổ lượng*[*permanent dead link*] - Photo of *sâm bổ lượng* This [soup](/wiki/Soup)-related article is a stub.
