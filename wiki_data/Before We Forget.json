  "content": "2011 Singaporean film ***Before We Forget*** is a 2011 observational [documentary film](/wiki/Documentary_film) about two Singaporean women with [dementia](/wiki/Dementia) and their life within Singaporean society, where terminal illnesses and dying are taboo.[*citation needed*] It is directed by Singaporean first-time filmmakers Jeremy Boo and Lee Xian Jie, who have also started an online platform that encourages people in Asia to share their experiences about dementia. ## Synopsis The film tells the story of Joyce Fernandez, a 50-year-old woman caring for her mother, Celine Fernandez, who has had [Alzheimer's disease](/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease) for seven years. When Celine suffers a mild [stroke](/wiki/Stroke) and is hospitalized for over three months, Joyce attempts to keep herself together, especially after Celine loses all of what little speech and she originally had. The duo, staunch [Catholics](/wiki/Catholics), keep their heads above the emotional turmoil through daily prayer. The documentary also captures frank interviews with Dr Irene Giam (PhD), a former mathematics tutor and [atheist](/wiki/Atheist), with strong views about death in the face of [terminal illness](/wiki/Terminal_illness). She is first filmed after being diagnosed with [mild cognitive impairment](/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment), likely due to systemic fibrosis, an [autoimmune disorder](/wiki/Autoimmune_disorder) which affects her breathing. After she is warded in a hospice because of her rapidly worsening health, [vascular dementia](/wiki/Vascular_dementia) causes her to forget the frequent visits by her husband and deepens her feelings of loneliness. ## Release The film was screened during the 2012 Southeast Asian Film Festival. - Official website - *Before We Forget* at [IMDb](/wiki/IMDb_(identifier)) - Official trailer on [Vimeo](/wiki/Vimeo) This article related to a Singaporean film is a stub.
