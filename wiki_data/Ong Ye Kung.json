Following that, he joined the [National Trades Union Congress](/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress) as Assistant Secretary-General. ### Political career In the [2011 general election](/wiki/2011_Singaporean_general_election), Ong contested in [Aljunied GRC](/wiki/Aljunied_Group_Representation_Constituency) as part of a five-member [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) team. The PAP team lost to the [Workers' Party's](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_Singapore) (WP) team of [Low Thia Khiang](/wiki/Low_Thia_Khiang), [Pritam Singh](/wiki/Pritam_Singh_(Singaporean_politician)), [Sylvia Lim](/wiki/Sylvia_Lim), [Muhamad Faisal Manap](/wiki/Muhamad_Faisal_Manap) and [Chen Show Mao](/wiki/Chen_Show_Mao). This was the first time in Singapore's history when the PAP lost a GRC in an election. Ong was subsequently regulated into branch chair duties as unelected Kaki Bukit Branch Chair. Ong would later leave his branch chair post in 2014. Following the 2011 general election, Ong continued to work at the [National Trades Union Congress](/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress) (NTUC) and became Deputy Secretary-General in June 2011. He was also elected into the NTUC's Central Committee later that year. In 2013, he left the NTUC and became Director of Group Strategy at [Keppel Corporation](/wiki/Keppel_Corporation). In the [2015 general election](/wiki/2015_Singaporean_general_election), Ong joined as part of the five-member PAP team contesting in [Sembawang GRC](/wiki/Sembawang_Group_Representation_Constituency), The PAP team won with 72% of the vote and Ong was elected as the Member of Parliament representing the Gambas ward of Sembawang GRC. On 1 October 2015, Ong was appointed [Senior Minister of State for Defence](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Singapore)) and [Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills)](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)). On 1 November 2016, he was promoted to Second Minister for Defence while concurrently holding the portfolio of Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) alongside [Ng Chee Meng](/wiki/Ng_Chee_Meng), who was Minister for Education (Schools). In 2017, Ong moved a bill in Parliament to confer the [Singapore University of Social Sciences](/wiki/Singapore_University_of_Social_Sciences) autonomous status. On 1 May 2018, the two Education portfolios were merged into a single one; Ong took over the single portfolio as Minister for Education while simultaneously relinquishing his Second Minister of Defence portfolio. On 27 July 2020, Ong relinquished his portfolio as Minister for Education and succeeded [Khaw Boon Wan](/wiki/Khaw_Boon_Wan) as [Minister for Transport](/wiki/Ministry_of_Transport_(Singapore)). In the lead-up to the [2020 general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election), Ong was widely seen as one of the three leading candidates (alongside [Heng Swee Keat](/wiki/Heng_Swee_Keat) and [Chan Chun Sing](/wiki/Chan_Chun_Sing)) to succeed [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) as [Prime Minister of Singapore](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore). Ong led the PAP team in Sembawang GRC and they won with about 67% of the vote. Ong's former Gambas ward was merged with part of Khaw Boon Wan's former Sembawang ward, forming the new Sembawang Central ward which Ong has since represented. On 23 April 2021, Ong was appointed co-chair of the multi-ministerial committee formed on 22 January 2020 to manage the [COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Singapore). Following a Cabinet reshuffle on 15 May 2021, Ong relinquished his portfolio as Minister for Transport and succeeded [Gan Kim Yong](/wiki/Gan_Kim_Yong) as [Minister for Health](/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Singapore)). Ong was considered by many to be one of the most likely candidates to succeed [Heng Swee Keat](/wiki/Heng_Swee_Keat) as leader of the fourth-generation (4G) team, however it was ultimately revealed that Finance Minister [Lawrence Wong](/wiki/Lawrence_Wong) had the most support compared to the other candidates. On 23 April 2025, Ong stood for re-election in Sembawang GRC, and was successfully nominated. He led the PAP team, which also consisted of incumbent MPs [Mariam Jaafar](/wiki/Mariam_Jaafar) and [Vikram Nair](/wiki/Vikram_Nair), and new faces [Gabriel Lam](/wiki/Gabriel_Lam_(Singaporean_politician)) and [Ng Shi Xuan](/wiki/Ng_Shi_Xuan). His team won in a three-cornered fight with the [National Solidarity Party](/wiki/National_Solidarity_Party_(Singapore)) (NSP) and [Singapore Democratic Party](/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Party) (SDP). On 6 May 2025, 3 days after the general election, Ong, alongside fellow ministers [Chee Hong Tat](/wiki/Chee_Hong_Tat) and [Ng Chee Meng](/wiki/Ng_Chee_Meng) (who later requested to be excluded from the Cabinet), was caught in a publicised scandal of the three dining with convicted money launderer [Su Haijin](/wiki/2023_Singapore_money_laundering_case). ## Other appointments - Board Member, [Monetary Authority of Singapore](/wiki/Monetary_Authority_of_Singapore) (29 Aug 2016 – 31 May 2019) - Board Member, [SMRT Corporation](/wiki/SMRT_Corporation) (2006–2014) As an independent director, he was appointed to head an internal investigation into the major train disruptions between 15 and 17 December 2011. - Chairman, Employment and Employability Institute[*citation needed*] - Adviser, National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU), Singapore Industrial and Services Employees’ Union (SISEU), and Attractions, Resorts & Entertainment Union (AREU)[*citation needed*] - Executive Secretary, National Transport Workers' Union and the Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers' Union.[*citation needed*] ## Personal life Ong's father, Ong Lian Teng, was a [Barisan Sosialis](/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis) politician who served as the Member of the [Legislative Assembly](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore) for [Bukit Panjang](/wiki/Bukit_Panjang_Single_Member_Constituency) between 1963 and 1965 and later MP between 1965 and 1966, when he resigned to protest the \"undemocratic acts\" of the PAP government. In an interview with *[The Straits Times](/wiki/The_Straits_Times)* in 2011, Ong Ye Kung said that his father, who died in 2009, had been fully supportive of his son's entry into PAP politics despite his own involvement in opposition politics. Ong is married to Diana Kuik Sin Leng, the daughter of real estate magnate Kuik Ah Han. They have two daughters. In 2012, Straits Times correspondent [Susan Long](/wiki/Susan_Long_(journalist)) described him as a \"free thinker\" and a \"Confucius-quoting unionist\".

He contested and lost in the [Division of Tangney](/wiki/Division_of_Tangney) under the [Liberal Party](/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia) ticket in the [2025 federal election](/wiki/2025_Australian_federal_election).
