  "content": "Church in SingaporeChurch in Singapore , Singapore The **Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church** ([Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese): 布连拾街长老会磐石堂) is located on Prinsep Street within [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore)'s [central business district](/wiki/Central_business_district). It is approximately 350 metres from [Rochor MRT station](/wiki/Rochor_MRT_station). The church, previously known as the Malay Mission Chapel, was founded by Rev. Benjamin Peach Keasberry in 1843. The [chapel](/wiki/Chapel) was replaced with the present [Romanesque](/wiki/Romanesque_architecture)-style building in 1930. It was [gazetted](/wiki/Gazette) a [national monument](/wiki/National_Monuments_of_Singapore) by [Singapore's National Heritage Board](/wiki/National_Heritage_Board_(Singapore)) on 12 January 2000. ## History In 1843, Rev. Keasberry was able to raise sufficient funds to build a small chapel on Prinsep Street for outreach to the [Malay people](/wiki/Malay_people). By the early 20th century, the area around the church became densely populated. This led Scotsman James Milner Fraser to start the 1st Company of the [Singapore Boys’ Brigade](/wiki/The_Boys%27_Brigade_in_Singapore) in the church. Its formation in 1930 led to a large number of young people joining the church. In 1950, the 7th Girls' Brigade Company was formed in the church, drawing the students from the [Singapore Chinese Girls' School](/wiki/Singapore_Chinese_Girls%27_School) and the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) in Victoria Street. In the 1960s, the Church operated a kindergarten in the mornings. An outreach ministry was started in [Woodlands](/wiki/Woodlands,_Singapore) in 1983. Then in 1984, a tuition outreach ministry began at 25 Adam Road. In 1992, the Woodlands and Adam Road ministries merged to form the Woodlands-Adam Road Ministry. This was eventually reconstituted as Adam Road Presbyterian Church in 1997. Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church was [gazetted](/wiki/Gazette) a [national monument](/wiki/National_Monuments_of_Singapore) by the [National Heritage Board](/wiki/National_Heritage_Board_(Singapore)) of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) on 12 January 2000. ## Architecture The Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church was designed by [architect](/wiki/Architect) C.J. Stephens of [Swan and Maclaren](/wiki/Swan_and_Maclaren). Its notable features are the deep red [bricks](/wiki/Brick) and raised [brickwork](/wiki/Brickwork) on the [tower](/wiki/Steeple_(architecture)) and [belfry](/wiki/Bell_tower). At the front of the church, lightly modelled brickwork rises high in [gable](/wiki/Gable) formation expressing the shape of the [roof](/wiki/Roof) and culminating in a [bell](/wiki/Church_bell) tower, now housing a [loudspeaker](/wiki/Loudspeaker). The buildings within the enclosure are all [rendered](/wiki/Stucco) and [painted](/wiki/Paint). ## Sunday Services The Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church conducts several multi-lingual services on Sunday. All services involve lay participation. Apart from English and Mandarin services, the church also holds services for [Filipino](/wiki/Filipinos) and [Myanmar](/wiki/Myanmar) worshippers, and is one of the few churches in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) to hold services in the [Mizo language](/wiki/Mizo_language). Presently, about 40 [Mizo people](/wiki/Mizo_people), mostly foreign domestic workers, worship in a room on the upper level of the church. - Christianity portal - [Presbyterian Church in Singapore](/wiki/Presbyterian_Church_in_Singapore) - [Singapore Life Church](/wiki/Singapore_Life_Church) - [Life Bible-Presbyterian Church](/wiki/Life_Bible-Presbyterian_Church) - [Christianity in Singapore](/wiki/Christianity_in_Singapore) - National Heritage Board (2002), *Singapore's 100 Historic Places*, Archipelago Press, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-4068-23-3 - Norman Edwards, Peter Keys (1996), *Singapore - A Guide to Buildings, Streets, Places*, Times Books International, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 9971-65-231-5 ## News articles - \"Church chronicles 170 years of history\".
