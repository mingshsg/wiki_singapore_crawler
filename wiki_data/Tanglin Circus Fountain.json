Please introduce links to this page from related articles. *(December 2025)*Building in Tanglin, Singapore **Tanglin Circus Fountain** was a water fountain built in the Tanglin Circus roundabout in front of the Omni Marco Polo Hotel in [Tanglin](/wiki/Tanglin), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It was demolished in 1977. ## History Plans for a fountain to be built in Tanglin Circus was first announced in October 1965, and the fountain was completed in September 1966. The fountain cost $98,000 to build, being 160 ft long with a 50 ft diameter bowl, with the water in the fountain cascading into a 60 ft diameter pool below. The fountain was the third of several fountains commissioned by Minister of Cultural and Social Affairs [Othman Wok](/wiki/Othman_Wok), and was constructed by [Siemens](/wiki/Siemens). However, by the late 1970s, the traffic circle had been the cause of frequent traffic jams around the area. A decision was made by the government to demolish Tanglin Circus, along with the fountain. Both the circus and the fountain began being demolished in January 1977. This article about a Singapore building or structure is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it. - v - t - e\n",
