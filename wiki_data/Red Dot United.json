  "content": "Singaporean political party **Red Dot United** ([abbreviation](/wiki/Abbreviation): **RDU**) is a [political party](/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Singapore) in Singapore. It was formed in 2020 by former members of the [Progress Singapore Party](/wiki/Progress_Singapore_Party) (PSP), including [Ravi Philemon](/wiki/Ravi_Philemon) and Michelle Lee. It positions itself as a party with a focus on policies promoting transparency, accountability and citizen engagement. RDU made its electoral debut in the [2020 general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election), contesting the five-member [Jurong Group Representation Constituency](/wiki/Jurong_Group_Representation_Constituency) (GRC) against the governing [People’s Action Party](/wiki/People%E2%80%99s_Action_Party) (PAP). It received 25.38% of the vote. In the [2025 general election](/wiki/2025_Singaporean_general_election), RDU expanded its participation by fielding candidates in four constituencies: [Nee Soon GRC](/wiki/Nee_Soon_GRC), [Jurong East–Bukit Batok GRC](/wiki/Jurong_East%E2%80%93Bukit_Batok_GRC), [Holland–Bukit Timah GRC](/wiki/Holland%E2%80%93Bukit_Timah_GRC) and [Jurong Central Single Member Constituency](/wiki/Jurong_Central_Single_Member_Constituency) (SMC). It did not win any seats; its best result, 26.19% of the vote, was in Nee Soon GRC. Since its formation, RDU has focused on political outreach and policy advocacy, issuing statements and proposals on issues such as the cost of living, employment and electoral reform. ## History ### GE2020 RDU was founded on 26 May 2020 by members of the [Progress Singapore Party](/wiki/Progress_Singapore_Party) (PSP) who had resigned from the PSP. Although the average processing time for a registration application is two months, RDU received approval on 15 June 2020, three weeks after application, in what appeared to be an expedited process. RDU had put forward candidates to contest the five-seat [Jurong GRC](/wiki/Jurong_Group_Representation_Constituency), helmed by [Senior Minister](/wiki/Senior_Minister_of_Singapore) [Tharman Shanmugaratnam](/wiki/Tharman_Shanmugaratnam), for the [general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election), which was called on 23 June 2020 with the dissolution of the [13th Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/13th_Parliament_of_Singapore). On 10 July, their only team lost to the PAP team in the election with the widest winning margin of 49.22% percentage-points. ### GE2025 After the release of the electoral boundaries for the [2025 general election](/wiki/2025_Singaporean_general_election), RDU announced their intention to contest six constituencies: [Jurong East–Bukit Batok GRC](/wiki/Jurong_East%E2%80%93Bukit_Batok_Group_Representation_Constituency), [Nee Soon GRC](/wiki/Nee_Soon_Group_Representation_Constituency), [Tanjong Pagar GRC](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar_GRC), [Jurong Central SMC](/wiki/Jurong_Central_SMC), [Jalan Kayu SMC](/wiki/Jalan_Kayu_SMC) and [Radin Mas SMC](/wiki/Radin_Mas_SMC). On 15 March 2025, RDU held a porridge distribution event in Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC, where they introduced potential candidate Pang Heng Chuan. On 24 May 2025, RDU announced plans to evolve from a check-and-balance role into an alternative government. Following GE2025, where it secured 23.35% of the vote, RDU introduced a \"3B strategy\" to rebrand and strengthen its leadership. It aims to collaborate with other opposition parties through a proposed digital platform, altgov.sg, to present policy alternatives. The party is also considering a name change as part of its long-term vision. ## Leadership ### List of secretaries-general NoNameTerm startTerm end1[Ravi Philemon](/wiki/Ravi_Philemon)26 May 2020*Incumbent* ### List of chairpersons NoNameTerm startTerm end1Michelle Lee26 May 202023 Apr 20212David Foo23 Apr 2021*Incumbent* ### Central Executive Committee TitleNameChairDavid FooSecretary-General[Ravi Philemon](/wiki/Ravi_Philemon)TreasurerLiyana DhamirahCommittee MembersAbdillah ZamzuriAlex LyeChips PangEmily WooFazli TalipMohamed FerozMohamed Nizar ## Electoral performance ### Parliament ElectionLeaderVotes%SeatsNCMPsPositionResultContestedTotal+/–SeatsWonLost(/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election)[Ravi Philemon](/wiki/Ravi_Philemon)31,2601.25%5050 / 930 / 2 10thNo seats(/wiki/2025_Singaporean_general_election)94,5663.96%150150 / 970 / 2 4thNo seats #### Seats contested ElectionConstituencies contestedContested vote %+/–(/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election)[5-member GRC](/wiki/Group_representation_constituency): [Jurong](/wiki/Jurong_Group_Representation_Constituency)25.4%—N/a(/wiki/2025_Singaporean_general_election)5-member GRC: [Jurong East-Bukit Batok](/wiki/Jurong_East-Bukit_Batok_Group_Representation_Constituency), [Nee-Soon](/wiki/Nee_Soon_Group_Representation_Constituency); 4-member GRC: [Holland-Bukit Timah](/wiki/Holland-Bukit_Timah_Group_Representation_Constituency); [SMC](/wiki/Constituencies_of_Singapore): [Jurong Central](/wiki/Jurong_Central_Single_Member_Constituency)22.44% - [Elections in Singapore](/wiki/Elections_in_Singapore) - [List of political parties in Singapore](/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Singapore) - [Politics of Singapore](/wiki/Politics_of_Singapore) - Official website\n",
