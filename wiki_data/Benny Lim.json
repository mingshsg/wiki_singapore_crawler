  "content": "* *Benny Lim** (born 1980, in Singapore) was the [artistic director](/wiki/Artistic_director) of the now defunct the Fun Stage, a [non-profit](/wiki/Non-profit) theatre group in Singapore. He obtained a [Doctor of Philosophy](/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy) from the Division of [Drama](/wiki/Drama), [University of Glamorgan](/wiki/University_of_Glamorgan) (now known as the [University of South Wales](/wiki/University_of_South_Wales)) in 2012. ## Biography In 2001, at the age of 21, he founded the Fun Stage and has since held on to the record as the youngest artistic director of a theatre company in Singapore. In 2006, one of Benny's plays, *Existence*, was published in Singapore. *Existence* was written in 2003, inspired by the poetry of [Cyril Wong](/wiki/Cyril_Wong), as a response to [Leslie Cheung](/wiki/Leslie_Cheung)'s suicide. The play was mentioned in *[Time](/wiki/Time_(magazine))* magazine (10 August 2003) as a story that \"portrays the love of two young Singaporean men for each other as doomed\". In 2015, Benny co-curated Umbrella Festival, an arts festival in Hong Kong, in response to city's [Umbrella Movement](/wiki/Umbrella_Movement). ## Censorship Benny's works often deal with social-political issues within a [postmodern](/wiki/Postmodern) society. In 2004, Benny organized the Lovers' Lecture Series, which was not given a go-ahead by the Public Entertainment Licensing Unit (PELU) under the [Singapore Police Force](/wiki/Singapore_Police_Force). In 2005, Benny collaborated with artist Brian Gothong Tan on a devised play, Human Lefts. The content of the play, which was on the issue of the death penalty, was given a total ban by the [Media Development Authority of Singapore](/wiki/Media_Development_Authority_of_Singapore) (MDA).\n",
