  "content": "Planning Area in the Central Region of SingaporePlanning Area in Central Region, Singapore **Novena** ([IPA](/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): /noʊˈviːnə, -nɑː/ *noh-VEE-nə*) is a [planning area](/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore) located within the [Central Region](/wiki/Central_Region,_Singapore) of Singapore. Novena is bounded by [Toa Payoh](/wiki/Toa_Payoh) to the north, [Bukit Timah](/wiki/Bukit_Timah) to the west, [Tanglin](/wiki/Tanglin) to the south and [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang) to the east. It comprises five subzones, namely [Balestier](/wiki/Balestier), Dunearn, Malcolm, Mount Pleasant and Moulmein. While Novena is not classified as a \"new town\" by the [Housing and Development Board](/wiki/Housing_and_Development_Board) (HDB), the estate of [Whampoa](/wiki/Whampoa,_Singapore) within the subzone of [Balestier](/wiki/Balestier) constitutes part of the [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang)/Whampoa New Town. The vicinity is named after the [Novena](/wiki/Novena) prayer devotions to [Our Mother of Perpetual Help](/wiki/Our_Mother_of_Perpetual_Help), originally established by the [Redemptorist Order](/wiki/Redemptorist_Order) that settled and propagated within the area. In later years, the [Tan Tock Seng Hospital](/wiki/Tan_Tock_Seng_Hospital) was set in 1844, one of the oldest and busiest [hospitals](/wiki/Hospitals) in Singapore. ## Etymology Novena and its associated roads, buildings and [Mass Rapid Transit](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) station are named after [Novena Church](/wiki/Novena_Church) (canonically the Church of Saint Alphonsus Liguori) located in the area. Balestier Road was named after [Joseph Balestier](/wiki/Joseph_Balestier), an American diplomat who served in Singapore in the 1800s. ## Infrastructure ### Housing Land in Novena is very expensive because of its close proximity to the [Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore).

The Clinical Sciences Building of the [Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine](/wiki/Lee_Kong_Chian_School_of_Medicine) and various leisure and public spaces complete the complex. A number of private healthcare providers are situated next to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The private cluster is anchored by [Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital](/wiki/Mount_Elizabeth_Novena_Hospital), with standalone outpatient clinics leveraging on [network effects](/wiki/Network_effect) setting up in Novena Medical Centre, Novena Specialist Centre and Royal Square Novena. ### Commercial Central to this area is [Novena Square](/wiki/Novena_Square), a mixed used development situated directly above the [Novena MRT station](/wiki/Novena_MRT_station).
