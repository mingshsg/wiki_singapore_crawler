  "content": "Subzone of Geylang Planning Area in Singapore **Aljunied** (/ælˈdʒuːnɪd/ *al-JOO-nid*) is a suburban area located in the central part of the [city-state](/wiki/City-state) of Singapore. Named after Aljunied Road, it was formerly agricultural land which has since been heavily urbanised and presently comprises a variety of land uses. Today, Aljunied is a bustling neighbourhood with [HDB](/wiki/Housing_and_Development_Board) [flats](/wiki/Apartment) with amenities like shops, schools, parks and recreational facilities, as well as several traditional Singaporean shophouses. ## Etymology Syed Sharif Omar bin Ali Al Junied owned large tracts of agricultural land in the area. In [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang), he established a business after migrating from his hometown in [Tarim](/wiki/Tarim,_Yemen), [Yemen](/wiki/Yemen). Syed Omar came from the well-respected Arab family who were [descendants](/wiki/Kinship) of the [Islamic prophet](/wiki/Prophets_in_Islam) [Muhammad](/wiki/Muhammad). Masjid Kampong Melaka was renamed [Masjid Omar Kampong Melaka](/wiki/Masjid_Omar_Kampong_Melaka) in his honour. In 1823, at the behest of [Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles), Syed Omar donated the land on which [St Andrew's Cathedral](/wiki/St_Andrew%27s_Cathedral,_Singapore) now stands. He and his family also donated land for the establishment of [Tan Tock Seng Hospital](/wiki/Tan_Tock_Seng_Hospital). Syed Omar's descendants continue to reside in Singapore. Madrasah Aljunied was a leading Islamic religious school that produced many religious leaders of Southeast Asian countries. ## Education This section **does not cite any sources**.
