  "content": "* *Hainanese curry rice** is a [Singaporean](/wiki/Singaporean) dish consisting of steamed white rice smothered with curries and gravy, characteristically accompanied by [curry chicken](/wiki/Curry_chicken), [pork chop](/wiki/Pork_chop), [chap chye](/wiki/Chap_chye) (braised cabbage) and kong bak (braised pork). It originates in [Singaporean cuisine](/wiki/Singaporean_cuisine) and is not thought of as part of the [cuisine of Hainan, China](/wiki/Hainan_cuisine) although it was created by [Hainanese people](/wiki/Hainan_people). ## History Hainanese curry rice developed during [British colonial rule in Singapore](/wiki/Colonial_Singapore). It was started by [Hainanese](/wiki/Hainan_people) living in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), who were often employed by the British as well as the wealthy [Peranakans](/wiki/Peranakan) (Straits-Chinese) as chefs in their homes. Pork chop was adapted from [British cuisine](/wiki/British_cuisine) and the rest of the ingredients, such as curry chicken, babi pongteh and chap chye, were from [Peranakan cuisine](/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine). These were adapted for Hainanese curry rice. Loo's, one of the most well-known and popular Hainanese curry rice vendors in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), started operations in 1946 and is situated in [Tiong Bahru Market](/wiki/Tiong_Bahru_Market). ## Description ### Rice Traditionally, steamed white rice forms the base of this dish. In recent years, some outlets, for example Jin Soon Fa Curry Rice, offer brown rice as an option. ### Curry The curry is milder and thicker than its South Asian variant. - [Teochew porridge](/wiki/Teochew_porridge) - [List of rice dishes](/wiki/List_of_rice_dishes)\n",
