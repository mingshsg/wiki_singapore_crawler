  "content": "* *Queenstown Constituency** was a constituency in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It existed from 1955 to 1988. ## History Queenstown Constituency was established prior to the [1955 general election](/wiki/1955_Singaporean_general_election) in [colonial Singapore](/wiki/Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements). Lee Choon Eng from the [Labour Front](/wiki/Labour_Front) (LF) defeated candidates from the [Democratic Party](/wiki/Democratic_Party_(Singapore)) (DP) and [Progressive Party](/wiki/Progressive_Party_(Singapore)) (PP) with 67.28% of the vote. During the [1959 general election](/wiki/1959_Singaporean_general_election), [Lee Siew Choh](/wiki/Lee_Siew_Choh), candidate for the now-dominant [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP), won the constituency with 53.81% of the vote, consistent with the party's initial rise to power where it won 43 out of 51 seats in the [Legislative Assembly](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore). However, he would leave the PAP in 1961, after it expelled its left-wing faction, to become a member of [Barisan Sosialis](/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis) (BS), a new party started by members of the faction. In the [1963 general election](/wiki/1963_Singaporean_general_election), Lee Siew Choh did not run for Queenstown; [Jek Yeun Thong](/wiki/Jek_Yeun_Thong) reclaimed it for the PAP, defeating Lee Ek Chong from BS and two other candidates with 52.81% of the vote. He would retain the constituency, both unopposed and against different opposition candidates, until the [1988 general election](/wiki/1988_Singaporean_general_election), after Singapore had become independent and the Legislative Assembly had been replaced with the [Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore). In 1988, the constituency was merged into [Brickworks Group Representation Constituency](/wiki/Brickworks_Group_Representation_Constituency) (GRC) following the establishment of [GRCs](/wiki/Group_representation_constituency). All constituencies represented by a single MP were renamed [single-member constituencies](/wiki/Single-member_constituencies) (SMCs). ## Members of Parliament **Election** **Member****Party****Formation****1955**Lee Choon Eng[LF](/wiki/Labour_Front)**1959**[Lee Siew Choh](/wiki/Lee_Siew_Choh)[PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)[BS](/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis)**1963**[Jek Yeun Thong](/wiki/Jek_Yeun_Thong)[PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)[Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore)**1968**[Jek Yeun Thong](/wiki/Jek_Yeun_Thong)[PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)**1972****1976****1980****1984****Constituency abolished (1988)** ## Electoral results Note: The [Elections Department](/wiki/Elections_Department_Singapore) does not include rejected votes when calculating the vote shares of candidates.
