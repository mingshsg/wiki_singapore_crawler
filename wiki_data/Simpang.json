  "content": "Planning Area in Singapore **Simpang** ([IPA](/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): /ˈsɪmpʌŋ/ *SIM-pung*) is a [planning area](/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore) located in the [North Region](/wiki/North_Region,_Singapore) of Singapore. The word *Simpang* means junction or intersection in [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language). It is situated north of [Yishun](/wiki/Yishun), east of [Sembawang](/wiki/Sembawang) and west of [Seletar](/wiki/Seletar). [Pulau Seletar](/wiki/Pulau_Seletar) is classified under Simpang planning area. *Jalan Kuala Simpang* was the main road serving the area. [Sungei Simpang Kiri](/wiki/Sungei_Simpang_Kiri), Sungei Simpang Kanan and Simpang Kiri Park Connector retain and reflect the name of the area. Simpang is currently a swamp area which is used by the [Singapore Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces) as a training ground since the early 1996, after the plan of developing a \"Simpang New Town\" was rejected. In the original 1993 plan, the area was slated for 20,000 housing units in a low density. After the rejection and lull, there are plans for it to be converted into a high-density housing estate. Simpang has four subzones for statistical and planning purposes: Pulau Seletar, Simpang North, Simpang South and Tanjong Irau. This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
