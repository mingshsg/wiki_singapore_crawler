  "content": "British and American documentarian (born 1970) **Louis Sebastian Theroux** (*LOO-ee thə-ROO*; born 20 May 1970) is a British and American documentarian, journalist, broadcaster, and author. He has received three [British Academy Television Awards](/wiki/British_Academy_Television_Awards) and a [Royal Television Society Television Award](/wiki/Royal_Television_Society#Awards). After graduating from [Magdalen College, Oxford](/wiki/Magdalen_College,_Oxford), Theroux moved to the United States and worked as a journalist for *[Metro Silicon Valley](/wiki/Metro_Silicon_Valley)* and *[Spy](/wiki/Spy_(magazine))*. He moved into television as the presenter of offbeat segments on [Michael Moore](/wiki/Michael_Moore)'s *[TV Nation](/wiki/TV_Nation)* series. Theroux is known for [his numerous documentaries with the BBC](/wiki/List_of_Louis_Theroux_documentaries), beginning with *[Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends](/wiki/Louis_Theroux%27s_Weird_Weekends)* (1998–2000), followed by *[When Louis Met...](/wiki/When_Louis_Met...)* (2000–2002) and 50 [BBC Two specials](/wiki/Louis_Theroux%27s_BBC_Two_specials) (2003–present). His work includes studies of unusual and taboo subcultures, crime and the justice system, and celebrities. The majority of his documentaries are set in the United States, but he has also studied cultures in [South Africa](/wiki/Culture_of_South_Africa), [Israel](/wiki/Culture_of_Israel), [Nigeria](/wiki/Culture_of_Nigeria), and the [UK](/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom). *[The New Yorker](/wiki/The_New_Yorker)* described Theroux's work as \"a piercingly humane, slyly funny guide through the funkier passages of [American culture](/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States)\". ## Early life Louis Sebastian Theroux was born in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) on 20 May 1970; he is the son of English mother Anne (née Castle) and American father [Paul Theroux](/wiki/Paul_Theroux), a noted travel writer and novelist. His paternal grandmother, Anne Dittami, was an Italian-American grammar school teacher, while his paternal grandfather, Albert Eugène Theroux, was a French-Canadian salesman for the American Leather Oak company. Theroux holds dual British and American citizenship. He is the nephew of novelist [Alexander Theroux](/wiki/Alexander_Theroux) and writer [Peter Theroux](/wiki/Peter_Theroux). His older brother, [Marcel](/wiki/Marcel_Theroux), is a writer and television presenter. His cousin, [Justin](/wiki/Justin_Theroux), is an actor and screenwriter. Theroux moved with his family to England when he was one year old; he was raised in the [Catford](/wiki/Catford) district of south London. He went from primary school to [Tower House School](/wiki/Tower_House_School) in [East Sheen](/wiki/East_Sheen) in 1979 or 1980 and then to [Westminster School](/wiki/Westminster_School), a [public school](/wiki/Public_school_(United_Kingdom)) within the precincts of [Westminster Abbey](/wiki/Westminster_Abbey). There, he befriended comedians [Adam Buxton](/wiki/Adam_Buxton) and [Joe Cornish](/wiki/Joe_Cornish), and future [Liberal Democrat](/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)) leader and Deputy Prime Minister [Nick Clegg](/wiki/Nick_Clegg), with whom he travelled to America. He also performed in a number of school theatre productions including *[Bugsy Malone](/wiki/Bugsy_Malone)* as Looney Bergonzi, *Ritual for Dolls* as the Army Officer, and *The Splendour Falls* as the Minstrel. He read Modern History at [Magdalen College, Oxford](/wiki/Magdalen_College,_Oxford) (1988–1991), graduating with [first-class honours](/wiki/First-class_honours). ## Career ### Early career Theroux's first employment as a journalist was in the United States with *[Metro Silicon Valley](/wiki/Metro_Silicon_Valley)*, an alternative free weekly newspaper in [San Jose, California](/wiki/San_Jose,_California). In 1992, he was hired as a writer for the satirical monthly magazine *[Spy](/wiki/Spy_(magazine)).* He also worked as a correspondent on [Michael Moore](/wiki/Michael_Moore)'s *[TV Nation](/wiki/TV_Nation)* series, for which he provided segments on offbeat cultural subjects, including selling [Avon](/wiki/Avon_Products) to women in the [Amazon rainforest](/wiki/Amazon_rainforest), the [Jerusalem syndrome](/wiki/Jerusalem_syndrome), and attempts by the [Ku Klux Klan](/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan) to rebrand itself as a civil rights group for white people.[*citation needed*] When *TV Nation* ended, Theroux signed a development deal with the [BBC](/wiki/BBC), where he developed *[Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends](/wiki/Louis_Theroux%27s_Weird_Weekends)*. He has written for a number of publications, including *[Hip Hop Connection](/wiki/Hip_Hop_Connection)* and *[The Idler](/wiki/The_Idler_(1993))*. ### Documentaries #### *Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends* In *[Weird Weekends](/wiki/Louis_Theroux%27s_Weird_Weekends)* (1998–2000), Theroux followed marginal (mostly American) subcultures such as [survivalists](/wiki/Survivalism), [black nationalists](/wiki/Black_nationalism), [white supremacists](/wiki/White_supremacy), and [porn stars](/wiki/Porn_star), often by living among or close to the people who were involved in them. His documentary method subtly exposes the contradictions or farcical elements of his subjects' seriously held beliefs. He described the aim of Weird Weekends as: > Setting out to discover the genuinely odd in the most ordinary setting. To me, it's almost a privilege to be welcomed into these communities and to shine a light on them and, maybe, through my enthusiasm, to get people to reveal more of themselves than they may have intended. The show is laughing at me, adrift in their world, as much as at them. I don't have to play up that stuff. I'm not a matinee idol disguised as a nerd. #### *When Louis Met...* In the series *[When Louis Met...](/wiki/When_Louis_Met...)* (2000–02), Theroux accompanied a different British celebrity in each programme in their daily lives, interviewing them as they go. His episode about British entertainer [Jimmy Savile](/wiki/Jimmy_Savile), entitled *When Louis Met Jimmy*, was voted one of the top documentaries of all time in a 2005 survey by Britain's [Channel 4](/wiki/Channel_4). Some years after the episode was filmed, the [NSPCC](/wiki/NSPCC) described Savile as \"one of the most prolific sex offenders\" in Great Britain. In an interview in 2015, Theroux expressed his intention to produce a follow-up documentary about Savile for the BBC to explore how the late entertainer had continued his abuse for so long, to meet people he knew closely, and examine his own reflections on his inability to dig more deeply into the first case. This follow-up documentary, titled *Savile*, aired on BBC Two on Sunday, 2 October 2016, and lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes. In *When Louis Met the Hamiltons*, the former [Conservative](/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)) [MP](/wiki/Member_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)) [Neil Hamilton](/wiki/Neil_Hamilton_(politician)) and his wife [Christine](/wiki/Christine_Hamilton) were arrested during the course of filming, due to false allegations of indecent assault. In *When Louis Met Max Clifford*, [Max Clifford](/wiki/Max_Clifford) tried to set up Theroux, but he was caught lying as the crew recorded his live microphone during the conversations. After this series concluded, a retrospective called *Life with Louis* was released. Theroux made a documentary called *[Louis, Martin & Michael](/wiki/Louis,_Martin_%26_Michael)* about his quest to get an interview with [Michael Jackson](/wiki/Michael_Jackson) to which he lost out to [Martin Bashir](/wiki/Martin_Bashir) who went on to make the documentary [Living With Michael Jackson](/wiki/Living_With_Michael_Jackson). Selected episodes of *When Louis Met...* were included as bonus content on a Best-Of collection of *Weird Weekends*. #### BBC Two specials In these special programmes, beginning in 2003, Theroux returned to American themes, working at feature-length and in a more natural way. In March 2006, he signed a new deal with the BBC to make 10 films over the course of three years. Subjects for the specials include criminal gangs in [Lagos](/wiki/Lagos), [Neo-Nazis in America](/wiki/Louis_and_the_Nazis), [ultra-Zionists in Israel](/wiki/The_Ultra_Zionists). He also explores [child psychiatry](/wiki/Child_and_adolescent_psychiatry), and the prison systems in California and Florida. A 2007 special, *[The Most Hated Family in America](/wiki/The_Most_Hated_Family_in_America)*, received strong critical praise from the international media. #### *My Scientology Movie* In October 2016, Theroux premiered a [feature-length](/wiki/Feature_length) documentary, *My Scientology Movie*. Produced by [Simon Chinn](/wiki/Simon_Chinn)—a school friend of Theroux's—and directed by John Dower, the film covers Theroux attempting to gain access to the secretive [Church of Scientology](/wiki/Church_of_Scientology). It premiered at the [London Film Festival](/wiki/London_Film_Festival) in 2015 and was released in cinemas in the UK on 7 October 2016. #### *Forbidden America* (2022) *Forbidden America* is a three-part series focusing on social media use in the United States among several groups, including the [alt-right](/wiki/Alt-right), rappers and pornographic film actors. On the *Extreme and Online,* Louis meets the latest incarnation of the American far right: a political movement born out of the internet and increasingly making its presence felt on the political stage. Theroux interviews [Nick Fuentes](/wiki/Nick_Fuentes) and [Baked Alaska](/wiki/Baked_Alaska_(livestreamer)). #### Interviews In 2022, the BBC announced a series of interviews conducted by Theroux under the title *Louis Theroux Interviews*, in which he meets and talks to celebrities from stage, screen and music about their successful careers and their personal lives. The first series started airing weekly on BBC Two on 25 October 2022 and features interviews from rapper [Stormzy](/wiki/Stormzy), actress [Dame Judi Dench](/wiki/Judi_Dench), musician [YUNGBLUD](/wiki/YUNGBLUD), adventurer [Bear Grylls](/wiki/Bear_Grylls), comedian [Katherine Ryan](/wiki/Katherine_Ryan) and singer [Rita Ora](/wiki/Rita_Ora). The second series of *Louis Theroux Interviews* started airing on 7 November 2023 and includes interviews from boxer [Anthony Joshua](/wiki/Anthony_Joshua), musician [Pete Doherty](/wiki/Pete_Doherty), actress [Joan Collins](/wiki/Joan_Collins), singer [Raye](/wiki/Raye), activist [Chelsea Manning](/wiki/Chelsea_Manning) and actor [Ashley Walters](/wiki/Ashley_Walters_(actor)). #### *The Settlers* (2025) Theroux spends time with the growing community of Israeli religious-nationalist settlers. Their settlements are illegal under international law, and they have been protected by the army, the police and the Israeli government. Since the start of the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war) there has been an acceleration in the establishment of settlements. The documentary explores the lives of both prominent settlers and Palestinian activists against a rise in violence against local Palestinian communities and the [October 2023 attack](/wiki/October_7_attacks) by [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas). ### Books Theroux published his first book, *The Call of the Weird: Travels in American Subcultures*, in Britain in 2005. In it, he recounts his return to the United States to learn about the lives of some of the people he had featured in his television programmes. Theroux released a memoir, *Gotta Get Theroux This*, in September 2019. He released his third book, *Theroux the Keyhole*, a diary recorded during the UK [COVID-19 lockdowns](/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns), in November 2021. ### Podcasts In April 2020, during a COVID-19 lockdown, Theroux started the [BBC Radio 4](/wiki/BBC_Radio_4) podcast *[Grounded with Louis Theroux](/wiki/Grounded_with_Louis_Theroux)* from his home, in which he interviews well-known people he finds particularly fascinating and to whom he would not necessarily have had a chance to speak before the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). Beginning on 6 June 2023, he started hosting *The Louis Theroux Podcast* as part of an exclusive deal with [Spotify](/wiki/Spotify). ### Other appearances Theroux makes a few appearances on *[The Adam and Joe Show](/wiki/The_Adam_and_Joe_Show)* DVD and has been a guest many times on [Adam & Joe](/wiki/Adam_%26_Joe)'s radio shows,[*citation needed*] as well as on *[The Adam Buxton Podcast](/wiki/The_Adam_Buxton_Podcast)*. As part of the *Weird Weekends* episode \"Porn\", Theroux agreed to film a cameo in the 1997 [gay pornography](/wiki/Gay_pornography) film *Take a Peak*. He did not perform sexual acts in the film, but made a brief appearance as a park ranger in search of a criminal. In the *Weird Weekends* episode \"Infomercials\", he featured as a live salesman for an at-home paper shredder for the [Home Shopping Network](/wiki/Home_Shopping_Network). In December 2015, Theroux captained the team representing [Magdalen College, Oxford](/wiki/Magdalen_College,_Oxford) on [BBC Four](/wiki/BBC_Four)'s *[Christmas University Challenge](/wiki/Christmas_University_Challenge)*. In their first-round match, the team beat the [University of Exeter](/wiki/University_of_Exeter)'s team by 220 to 130 and went on to win the tournament. In April 2022, Theroux went [viral](/wiki/Viral_video) after a clip of him on the [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube) show *[Chicken Shop Date](/wiki/Chicken_Shop_Date)*—in which he performed a short rap he had originally written and performed in the *[Weird Weekends](/wiki/Louis_Theroux%27s_Weird_Weekends)* episode \"*Gangsta Rap*\" 22 years earlier—was [autotuned](/wiki/Auto-Tune) by a [TikTok](/wiki/TikTok) user and turned into a reusable audio track with backing music. The trend saw users lip-syncing to the sound and performing an accompanying dance. It has led to more footage of Theroux's rapping ability being unearthed, leading the BBC to publish an article listing seven times he \"proved he was a massive [hip hop](/wiki/Hip_hop) head\". In May, Theroux released \"[Jiggle Jiggle](/wiki/Jiggle_Jiggle)\", a full version of the rap which he created alongside [Manchester](/wiki/Manchester) DJ duo Duke & Jones. ## Personal life Theroux's first marriage was to Susanna Kleeman until they divorced in 2002; he later told [Sathnam Sanghera](/wiki/Sathnam_Sanghera) of the *[Financial Times](/wiki/Financial_Times)*, \"What happened was that my girlfriend was living with me in [New York](/wiki/New_York_City). She was having trouble finding work ... legally. So we got married, to make it easier for her. We never really considered ourselves married in the full sense – there were no wedding photos or anything like that. It was really a [marriage of convenience](/wiki/Marriage_of_convenience).\" Theroux married his long-time girlfriend, Nancy Strang, on 13 July 2012. They have three sons together. In a 2012 masterclass, he spoke of the challenges of combining family life with the need to work on projects. They lived in the [Harlesden](/wiki/Harlesden) area of [London](/wiki/London) until temporarily moving to [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles) in early 2013, allowing him more time to focus on his *LA Stories* series. In 2017, they relocated to Los Angeles. Theroux and his family spent COVID-19 lockdowns at their home in North-West London. Theroux is an [atheist](/wiki/Atheism). He dabbled with [cannabis](/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)) at 17 and later said that, while he acknowledges that cannabis is an intoxicant and can trigger certain mental health issues, he supports [its legalisation](/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis). He has also revealed that he has a [fear of flying](/wiki/Fear_of_flying). In 2023, he announced that he suffers from [alopecia](/wiki/Alopecia) that has caused facial hair loss. In 2018, Theroux's [Twitter](/wiki/Twitter) account was hacked by [cybersecurity](/wiki/Cybersecurity) firm Insinia as part of their attempt to highlight a longstanding security flaw in Twitter's system. Theroux is a supporter of West London football club [Queens Park Rangers](/wiki/Queens_Park_Rangers). ## Awards ### British Academy Television Awards CategoryShowResult2002Richard Dimbleby Award for the Best Presenter (Factual, Features and News)*[When Louis Met...](/wiki/When_Louis_Met...)*WonFlaherty Documentary Award (TV)*[When Louis Met...
