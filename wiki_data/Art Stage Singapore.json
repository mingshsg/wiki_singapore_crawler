Rudolf initially rejected a proposal to launch [Art Basel](/wiki/Art_Basel) in Singapore in 1992 but later revisited the idea of creating a unique Asian art fair. The fair took nine years to be realized. The first edition was held in 2011 at [Marina Bay Sands](/wiki/Marina_Bay_Sands). The cancellation of the 2019 edition of the fair, which was a commercial decision, left the future of the fair in doubt. The [National Arts Council](/wiki/National_Arts_Council,_Singapore), [Singapore Tourism Board](/wiki/Singapore_Tourism_Board), and [Economic Development Board](/wiki/Economic_Development_Board), who supported the fair since its inception in 2011, released a joint statement after the cancellation expressing their disappointment.\n",
