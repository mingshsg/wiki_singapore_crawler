Prominently, he was also the father of [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) and the paternal grandfather of [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong), the first and third [Prime Minister of Singapore](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) respectively. ## Early life and career Lee was born on 1 June 1903 in the port city of [Semarang](/wiki/Semarang), [Central Java](/wiki/Central_Java), during [Dutch colonial rule](/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies). He was from an [upper-class](/wiki/Upper_class) family of [Straits Chinese descent](/wiki/Overseas_Chinese) and was raised in an English-speaking household. His parents were [Hakka](/wiki/Hakka_people)-Peranakan Lee Hoon Leong (1871–1942) and [Indonesian](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesians)-Peranakan Ko Liem Nio (1883–1959). His father, Lee Hoon Leong, worked as a [pharmacist](/wiki/Pharmacist) and later became a purser at [Heap Eng Moh Shipping Line](/wiki/Heap_Eng_Moh_Steamship_Co). His family later moved to Singapore when he was five, where he studied at [St. Joseph's Institution](/wiki/St._Joseph%27s_Institution,_Singapore). During the [Great Depression](/wiki/Great_Depression), Lee's family was affected but, in the 1930s, he managed to secure a job as a storekeeper for [Shell Oil Company](/wiki/Shell_Oil_Company), later becoming a manager after [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II). He later worked at a shop at High Street named [B.P. de Silva](/wiki/B.P._de_Silva), selling watches and jewellery. In 1957, he helped his son [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) campaign at the [Tanjong Pagar by-election](/wiki/1957_Singaporean_by-elections#Tanjong_Pagar). ## Personal life Lee married [Chua Jim Neo](/wiki/Chua_Jim_Neo) (1905–1980) on 20 May 1922 when he was 18 and she was 16 in a traditional Chinese [arranged marriage](/wiki/Arranged_marriage) by Chua's family. Together they had 5 children including the first Prime Minister of Singapore, [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew). In 1945, Lee and Chua bought a [bungalow](/wiki/Bungalow) at [38 Oxley Road](/wiki/38_Oxley_Road). Lee was a frequent gambler, usually being stood up by Chua when he went to gamble. In 1959, after Lee Kuan Yew was elected Prime Minister, Lee led a mostly private life, having told a cousin, \"I don't like publicity.\" ### Death Lee died on 12 October 1997 at the age of 94.
