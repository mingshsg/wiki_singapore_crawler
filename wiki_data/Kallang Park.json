Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *Find sources:* \"Kallang Park\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(July 2018)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* **Kallang Park** ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 劳动公园, [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language): *Taman Kallang*) was a large public park located in [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It existed from 1959 to early 1970s on the site currently occupied by the [Singapore Sports Hub](/wiki/Singapore_Sports_Hub). ## Etymology Kallang Park was so named because it was built on the site of the former [Kallang Airport](/wiki/Kallang_Airport) runway, on the eastern bank of the Kallang Basin. The area is now part of the Kallang planning area. Its [Chinese](/wiki/Standard_Chinese) name \"劳动公园\", however, translates to \"labour park\". Its [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) name \"*Taman Kallang*\" is a translation based on the English version. ## History Plans to convert the lands of the former [Kallang Airport](/wiki/Kallang_Airport) into public spaces were first announced by then-Minister for [National Development](/wiki/Ministry_of_National_Development_(Singapore)) [Ong Eng Guan](/wiki/Ong_Eng_Guan) as \"Project Long\" in 1950s. It was constructed with the involvement of both the government and volunteers. The park was officially opened on 18 October 1959 by Parliamentary Secretary to the [Ministry of Labour and Law](/wiki/Ministry_of_Manpower_(Singapore)) [Wee Toon Boon](/wiki/Wee_Toon_Boon). In July 1969, the Wonderland Amusement Park was integrated into the Kallang Park, costing an estimated amount of S$3 million in construction. In 1970, Singapore's largest cinema at that time, the Kallang Cinema (now the [Kallang Theatre](/wiki/Kallang_Theatre)), was built in the Kallang Park. By 1973, the [former National Stadium](/wiki/Former_National_Stadium,_Singapore) was erected at the site of the Kallang Park. Today, the same site has been redeveloped into the [Singapore Sports Hub](/wiki/Singapore_Sports_Hub), consisting of the [new National Stadium](/wiki/National_Stadium,_Singapore), [Singapore Indoor Stadium](/wiki/Singapore_Indoor_Stadium) and numerous other sports facilities. The name \"Kallang Park\" is now preserved in the row of godowns along [Jalan Benaan Kapal](/wiki/Jalan_Benaan_Kapal). ## Facility Kallang Park had entertainment facilities for both adults and children, including kart racing, agriculture shows, roller coaster, ferris wheel, nightclub, bowling centre and ice skating rink, among others. Its most notable feature, however, was perhaps a fountain gifted by the [Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry](/wiki/Singapore_Chinese_Chamber_of_Commerce_and_Industry), noted for its futuristic design. 1°18′15.4″N 103°52′28.6″E﻿ / ﻿1.304278°N 103.874611°E﻿ / 1.304278; 103.874611\n",
