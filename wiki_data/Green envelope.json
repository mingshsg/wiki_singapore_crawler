  "content": "Malay adaptation of the Chinese red envelope custom A **green envelope** ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language): ***sampul hijau** or **sampul duit raya***) is an Islamic adaptation of the Chinese [red envelope](/wiki/Red_envelope) custom. During the festival of [Eid ul-Fitr](/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr), Muslims in [Malaysia](/wiki/Islam_in_Malaysia), [Brunei](/wiki/Islam_in_Brunei), [Singapore](/wiki/Islam_in_Singapore), and [Indonesia](/wiki/Islam_in_Indonesia) hand out money in green [envelopes](/wiki/Envelope) to guests who visit their homes. The colour [green](/wiki/Green#Green_in_Islam) was chosen for its association with the [Islamic paradise](/wiki/Islamic_paradise). The idea of handing out green envelopes is based on the Islamic concept of *[zakat](/wiki/Zakat)*, where every Muslim is required to provide at least 2.5% of their wealth to the needy. However, Malays now hand out these green envelopes during Eid not only to poor guests, but also to the [middle](/wiki/Middle_class) and [upper classes](/wiki/Upper_class). The amount of money depends on how much the host can afford to give their guests. - [Eidi (gift)](/wiki/Eidi_(gift)) - [Red envelope](/wiki/Red_envelope) This [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia)-related article is a stub.
