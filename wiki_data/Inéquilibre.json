Out of the twelve editions, only one is currently placed publicly within [SkySuite](/wiki/Skysuites_@_Anson), the highest residential tower in Singapore. ## Description This sculpture was inspired by the ruined temples under restoration at [Angkor Wat](/wiki/Angkor_Wat) in [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia). Each stone is removed, numbered, and each temple is reconstructed, embellished by the marks of time. The man moves alongside, serene and as a witness of his own time. The sculpture questions the place of mankind, the search for harmony within the imbalance (inéquilibre) that is offered to us. This sculpture article is a stub.
