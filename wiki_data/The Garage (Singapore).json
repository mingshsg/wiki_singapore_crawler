  "content": "Historic building in the Singapore Botanic Gardens **The Garage** is a historic building in the [Singapore Botanic Gardens](/wiki/Singapore_Botanic_Gardens). Built in the 1920s, it currently houses the Bees Knee's cafe and the Au Balcon restaurant. ## Description The two-storey building was designed in the [Art Deco](/wiki/Art_Deco) style. It features a hip roof and a rendered finish, with seven individual garage spaces. The entrances to the garages on the ground floor feature half-round arches while staircases on either side of the building lead up to the first floor, which is set behind the front on the ground floor and made up of a single open space, featuring a truss roof of timber. ## History Completed sometime between 1924 and 1928, the building initially stood on the [University of Malaya](/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore)'s Bukit Timah Campus in Singapore. It served as a garage for the institution's professors. It also functioned as the [National Parks Board](/wiki/National_Parks_Board)'s horticulture department in the 1990s. It was gazetted for conservation by the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority) in June 2014. In February 2017, lifestyle F&B company 1-Group opened Bees Knee's, a 60-seater cafe bistro operating on the building's ground floor, and Botanico, modern European-style restaurant which occupies the first floor of the building. Botanico was later replaced by Au Balcon, which is also owned by 1-Group. 1°19′8″N 103°48′56″E﻿ / ﻿1.31889°N 103.81556°E﻿ / 1.31889; 103.81556\n",
