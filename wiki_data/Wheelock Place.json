  "content": "Shopping mall in Orchard, Singapore **Wheelock Place** ([Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 会德丰广场), ([Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_language) வீல்லாக் ப்லேஸ்) is a 21-floor office tower and [shopping mall](/wiki/Shopping_mall) on [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore)'s [Orchard Road](/wiki/Orchard_Road). ## Background The building was designed by [Kisho Kurokawa](/wiki/Kisho_Kurokawa) and completed in 1994 as [Lane Crawford](/wiki/Lane_Crawford) Place ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 达卡佛坊). It is now owned by [Wharf Estates Singapore](/wiki/Wharf_Estates_Singapore), formerly \"Wheelock Properties (Singapore)\", a division of [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong)'s [Wheelock and Co.](/wiki/Wheelock_and_Co.) It opened as 'Lane Crawford Place', housing the upmarket department store Lane Crawford over five floors. It featured the first curved escalators in Singapore, echoing Lane Crawford's installation of the first public curved escalators in the world in 1993 at their [Times Square (Hong Kong)] location, developed by Mitsubishi Electric. The store shut in 1996 and the building was renamed Wheelock Place following Lane Crawford's exit. The mall has an underpass to [Shaw House](/wiki/Shaw_House_and_Centre) and [ION Orchard](/wiki/ION_Orchard). It was the site of [Borders](/wiki/Borders_(retailer))' flagship Singapore store until its closure in 2011. Following which, [Marks & Spencer](/wiki/Marks_%26_Spencer) became Wheelock Place's main tenant. A new book shop, Zall Bookstore, opened in 2021. The mall houses multiple homegrown retail, food, and lifestyle brands. Among these are [Browhaus](/wiki/Browhaus), Cedele, and Privè. - [List of shopping malls in Singapore](/wiki/List_of_shopping_malls_in_Singapore) - Official website This article about a Singapore building or structure is a stub.
