  "content": "Defunct government body in Singapore The **Municipal Commission of Singapore**, originally the **Municipal Council** from 1856, was a body created in 1887 by the [British colonial government](/wiki/British_Singapore) to replace the Municipal Committee that was created in June 1848. The role of the commission was to manage key services for the [Town of Singapore](/wiki/Town_of_Singapore), such as utilities, water services and urban planning. The body had commission board members internally elected but ceased from 1913 until 1949, after which it acted like a quasi-municipal government for a brief period with local elections until the [City Council of Singapore](/wiki/City_Council_of_Singapore) was created in 1951. ## Background The commission elections took place twice ([April](/wiki/April_1949_Singapore_Municipal_Commission_election) and [December](/wiki/December_1949_Singapore_Municipal_Commission_election)) in 1949 as well as in (/wiki/1950_Singapore_Municipal_Commission_election) with six divisions: - City - East - North - Rochore - South - West Candidates largely consisted from two political parties, the [Progressive Party](/wiki/Progressive_Party_(Singapore)) (PP) and the [Labour Party](/wiki/Labour_Party_(Singapore)) (SLP), as well as independent candidates. - May Singapore Flourish!
