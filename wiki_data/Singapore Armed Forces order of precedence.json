This is the order in which the 36 Regimental Colours of the Singapore Armed Forces parade. The oldest Colours is placed on the left of the observer, and the sequence follows, with the youngest Colours taking the last position on the right. There are exceptions to this rule in the Singapore context, such as the placement of the Regimental Colours of the [Commandos](/wiki/Singapore_Commandos). SAFTI MI and Commandos Regimental Colours do not observe the order-by-date-of grant arrangement. These Colours precede the SAF's first Regimental Colours (1SIR - 27 July 1961), despite being granted on a later date. In [Air Force](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force) and [Navy](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Navy) parades, the respective Regimental Colours of these two services will be paraded in a similar order as listed below excluding those of the Army and joint-service units/formations. - [SAFTI Military Institute](/wiki/SAFTI_Military_Institute) - Headquarters, [Commandos](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_Commando_Formation) - [1st Commando Battalion](/wiki/Commandos_(Singapore_Army)) - 1st Battalion, [Singapore Infantry Regiment](/wiki/Singapore_Infantry_Regiment) - 2nd Battalion, [Singapore Infantry Regiment](/wiki/Singapore_Infantry_Regiment) - 3rd Battalion, [Singapore Infantry Regiment](/wiki/Singapore_Infantry_Regiment) - 5th Battalion, [Singapore Infantry Regiment](/wiki/Singapore_Infantry_Regiment) - 1st Battalion, [Singapore Guards](/wiki/Singapore_Guards) - 3rd Battalion, [Singapore Guards](/wiki/Singapore_Guards) - 40th Battalion, [Singapore Armoured Regiment](/wiki/Singapore_Armoured_Regiment) - 41st Battalion, [Singapore Armoured Regiment](/wiki/Singapore_Armoured_Regiment) - [42nd Battalion, Singapore Armoured Regiment](/wiki/42nd_Battalion,_Singapore_Armoured_Regiment) - 48th Battalion, [Singapore Armoured Regiment](/wiki/Singapore_Armoured_Regiment) - Headquarters, [Singapore Artillery](/wiki/Singapore_Artillery) - Headquarters, [Singapore Combat Engineers](/wiki/Singapore_Combat_Engineers) - Headquarters, [Signals](/wiki/Singapore_Signals) - Headquarters, [Maintenance and Engineering Support](/wiki/Maintenance_and_Engineering_Support) - [Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_Military_Police_Command) - Headquarters, Intelligence - 8th Battalion, [Singapore Infantry Regiment](/wiki/Singapore_Infantry_Regiment) - 9th Battalion, [Singapore Infantry Regiment](/wiki/Singapore_Infantry_Regiment) - Headquarters, Singapore Armed Forces Ammunition Command - Headquarters, Supply - Headquarters, Transport - [Army Deployment Force](/wiki/Army_Deployment_Force) - RSN Headquarters Fleet - RSN Naval Engineering and Logistics Command - RSN [Naval Diving Unit](/wiki/Naval_Diving_Unit_(Singapore)) - RSN [Maritime Security Task Force](/wiki/Maritime_Security_Task_Force) - RSAF [Air Defence and Operations Command](/wiki/Air_Defence_and_Operations_Command) - RSAF [Air Combat Command](/wiki/Air_Combat_Command) - RSAF [Participation Command](/wiki/Participation_Command) - RSAF [Air Power Generation Command](/wiki/Air_Power_Generation_Command) - RSAF [Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Command](/wiki/Unmanned_Aerial_Vehicle_Command) - Imagery Support Group - Headquarters, [Medical Corps](/wiki/Medical_Corps_(Singapore)) - Singapore Armed Forces, \"Our Army: Customs and Traditions\", 2006. - \"National Day Parade 2012: Trainer's Handbook\", 2012 This Asian [military](/wiki/Military) article is a stub.
