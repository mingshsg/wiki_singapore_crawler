The house was built in the late 19th century and was the residence of the first [prime minister of Singapore](/wiki/Prime_minister_of_Singapore), [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew), from the 1940s until his death in 2015. The first meeting of the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) occurred in the basement. In 2017, it became central to a dispute in Singapore among Lee's children, [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong), [Lee Hsien Yang](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Yang) and [Lee Wei Ling](/wiki/Lee_Wei_Ling), over its use and demolition. Lee Kuan Yew had originally willed the house to Lee Hsien Loong, who later sold it to Lee Hsien Yang in 2015 at market price, on the condition that both of them would donate half of the value to charity. Lee's will included a condition that his daughter Lee Wei Ling be allowed to stay there. She died on 9 October 2024, opening a range of plausible options for the house as set out by the Ministerial Committee in 2018. The options are to (i) retain the property by gazetting it as a National Monument or for conservation; (ii) retain the dining room and demolish the rest of the property; or (iii) allow the property to be demolished fully and allow for the site to be redeveloped. In 2025, the government announced their intentions to gazette it as a [national monument](/wiki/National_monuments_of_Singapore). ## Relation to other prominent families Kwa Geok Choo, the wife of Lee Kuan Yew, is the daughter of Wee Yew Neo, who is in turn the sister of Helene Tan, wife of [Tan Chin Tuan](/wiki/Tan_Chin_Tuan).
