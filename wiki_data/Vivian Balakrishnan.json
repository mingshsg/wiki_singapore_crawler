Balakrishnan and Helen Ong Yong Sang. His father was an [Indian Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_people), and his mother was Hokkien Chinese, with ancestry from [Fuqing](/wiki/Fuqing), [Fujian](/wiki/Fujian). He was educated at [Anglo-Chinese School](/wiki/Anglo-Chinese_School) and [National Junior College](/wiki/National_Junior_College) before he was conferred the [President's Scholarship](/wiki/President%27s_Scholar) in 1980 to study medicine at the [Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine](/wiki/Yong_Loo_Lin_School_of_Medicine) at the [National University of Singapore](/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore). He served two terms as the president of the NUS Student Union, and later the chairman of the union council. Balakrishnan chose a postgraduate specialisation in [ophthalmology](/wiki/Ophthalmology) and became a [fellow](/wiki/Fellow) of the [Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh](/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_Edinburgh) in 1991.[*citation needed*] ## Medical career Balakrishnan had worked at [Moorfields Eye Hospital](/wiki/Moorfields_Eye_Hospital) in [London](/wiki/London) between 1993 and 1995 as a specialist senior registrar, where he subspecialised in paediatric ophthalmology. When Balakrishnan returned to Singapore, he became a consultant ophthalmologist at the [Singapore National Eye Centre](/wiki/Singapore_National_Eye_Centre) and [National University Hospital](/wiki/National_University_Hospital), and an associate professor of ophthalmology at the [National University of Singapore](/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore) in 1998. In 1999, he became the medical director of the Singapore National Eye Centre, and later the chief executive officer of the [Singapore General Hospital](/wiki/Singapore_General_Hospital) in 2000. Balakrishnan was also the commanding officer of the 2nd Combat Support Hospital of the [Singapore Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces) (SAF) between 1999 and 2002. In the 1990s, he hosted the series *Health Matters* on Singapore television. ## Political career Balakrishnan made his political debut in the [2001 general election](/wiki/2001_Singapore_general_election) as part of the five-member PAP team contesting in [Holland–Bukit Panjang GRC](/wiki/Holland%E2%80%93Bukit_Panjang_GRC) and won by an uncontested walkover. He was subsequently appointed [Minister of State for National Development](/wiki/Ministry_of_National_Development_(Singapore)), and Chairman of the [Remaking Singapore Committee](/wiki/Remaking_Singapore_Committee) in 2002. He was later appointed [Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Trade_and_Industry_(Singapore)) in 2004. In 2004, Balakrishnan was appointed [acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports](/wiki/Ministry_of_Community_Development,_Youth_and_Sports#Ministers). He was made a full member of the [Cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Singapore) in 2005. During the [2006 general election](/wiki/2006_Singapore_general_election), Balakrishnan was part of a five-member PAP team led by [Lim Swee Say](/wiki/Lim_Swee_Say), contesting in [Holland–Bukit Timah GRC](/wiki/Holland%E2%80%93Bukit_Timah_GRC) and won with a walkover. During a Committee of Supply debate in [Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore) on 9 March 2007 regarding the estimates of expenditure for the [Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports](/wiki/Ministry_of_Community_Development,_Youth_and_Sports) (MCYS), an MP for [Jalan Besar GRC](/wiki/Jalan_Besar_Group_Representation_Constituency), [Lily Neo](/wiki/Lily_Neo) asked Balakrishnan whether the ministry would consider raising the Public Assistance rates for the purpose of ensuring recipients are able to have three meals a day, to which Balakrishnan replied with \"How much do you want? Do you want three meals in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant?\" In 2011, Balakrishnan raised the public assistance scheme from $260 in 2007 to $400 for a single-person household. During the [2011 general election](/wiki/2011_Singapore_general_election), Balakrishnan led a four-member PAP team which includes [Liang Eng Hwa](/wiki/Liang_Eng_Hwa), [Christopher de Souza](/wiki/Christopher_de_Souza) and [Sim Ann](/wiki/Sim_Ann) contesting in Holland–Bukit Timah GRC and won 60.1% of the vote. This was the first time Holland–Bukit Timah GRC were being contested since its formation in 2001. During the political campaign for the [2011 general election](/wiki/2011_Singaporean_general_election), Balakrishnan said that the candidates from the [Singapore Democratic Party](/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Party) (SDP) did not have any plans for the constituency, and their selection of Holland–Bukit Timah GRC was an opportunistic act. He suggested that they were trying to suppress a certain [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube) video featuring a member of their team and that it raised questions about their agenda and motivation. It was later discovered that the video included [Vincent Wijeysingha](/wiki/Vincent_Wijeysingha) at a forum discussing issues surrounding [gay rights](/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory) and [section 377A of the Penal Code](/wiki/Section_377A_of_the_Penal_Code_(Singapore)) in Singapore. The PAP team issued a statement asking the SDP team whether they were pursuing a \"gay agenda\". The SDP denied it, saying that they were not pursuing the gay agenda and the issue was put to rest. The PAP drew criticism from internet users in Singapore for their election strategy. At the same election, the SDP candidates raised the issue of [government spending](/wiki/Government_spending) for the [2010 Summer Youth Olympics](/wiki/2010_Summer_Youth_Olympics), which Balakrishnan had overseen as Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, saying that the budget exceeded the initial estimates of S$104 million by over three times. Balakrishnan acknowledged that they had got the initial estimates wrong as it was the first time that an event of that scale was organised in Singapore. He asserted that the increased budget did not affect other programmes of the ministry, and that 70% of the spending for the event went into paying local firms for their services. He declared that his team had spent less than the finalised budget amount and did not waste money. On 21 May 2011, Balakrishnan was appointed [Minister for the Environment and Water Resources](/wiki/Minister_for_the_Environment_and_Water_Resources), taking over from [Yaacob Ibrahim](/wiki/Yaacob_Ibrahim). After the [2015 general election](/wiki/2015_Singaporean_general_election), Balakrishnan was appointed [Minister for Foreign Affairs](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Singapore)). In response to a parliamentary question on 5 January 2021 regarding the use of data from the contact tracing app developed during the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Singapore) known as [TraceTogether](/wiki/TraceTogether), the Minister of State for [Home Affairs](/wiki/Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(Singapore)) [Desmond Tan](/wiki/Desmond_Tan_(politician)) replied that under the Criminal Procedure Code, the [Police](/wiki/Singapore_Police_Force) can access TraceTogether data for the purpose of criminal investigations, despite Balakrishnan's assurance to the public 8 months earlier in June 2020 that TraceTogether data will only be used for contact tracing purposes. Balakrishnan later said in Parliament \"I take full responsibility for this mistake. And I deeply regret the consternation and anxiety caused\". In September 2021, during a debate in [Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore) about the [Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement](/wiki/India-Singapore_Comprehensive_Economic_Cooperation_Agreement), a [hot mic](/wiki/Hot_mic) picked up Balakrishnan referring to [Non-constituency Member of Parliament](/wiki/Non-constituency_Member_of_Parliament) (NCMP) [Leong Mun Wai](/wiki/Leong_Mun_Wai) of the [Progress Singapore Party](/wiki/Progress_Singapore_Party) as \"illiterate\" and questioning how Leong got into [Raffles Institution](/wiki/Raffles_Institution) (RI) in a conversation with fellow PAP MPs on the front bench. Balakrishnan was subsequently called by Leong to apologise. In 2023, Balakrishnan and [K. Shanmugam](/wiki/K._Shanmugam) were investigated by the [Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau](/wiki/Corrupt_Practices_Investigation_Bureau) (CPIB) for [their rentals](/wiki/Ridout_Road_rentals) of state-owned bungalows at Ridout Road. The CPIB reported that they did not find any criminal wrongdoing or improper conduct. On 12 March 2025, [Minister for Law](/wiki/Ministry_of_Law_(Singapore)) and [Home Affairs](/wiki/Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(Singapore)), Shanmugam was confronted by two women from Monday of Palestine Solidarity group at his Meet-The-People session to address the [Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act](/wiki/Protection_from_Online_Falsehoods_and_Manipulation_Act). The confrontation was recorded on video and lasted seven minutes. On 13 March, [Calvin Cheng](/wiki/Calvin_Cheng), in a Facebook post, offered to send the activist group to [Gaza](/wiki/Gaza_Strip), provided they do not return to Singapore and also told their Facebook followers to leave Singapore for Gaza. It was later discovered that Balakrishnan and Senior Minister of State for National Development and Digital Development and Information [Tan Kiat How](/wiki/Tan_Kiat_How) had liked the post by Cheng. Tan claimed that he had accidentally like the post after Monday of Palestine Solidarity had questioned him about Cheng's post and had since “unliked” the Facebook post. Balakrishnan claimed he did not like the post and had since gotten [Meta](/wiki/Meta_Platforms), the owner and operator of Facebook, to investigate unauthorised activity on his Facebook account. ## Personal life He is married to Joy Chia Oon Su. They have a daughter and three sons. ## Notes - Vivian Balakrishnan on Prime Minister's Office - Vivian Balakrishnan on [Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore) - Vivian Balakrishnan's Blog Political officesPreceded by[Yaacob Ibrahim](/wiki/Yaacob_Ibrahim) **[Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports](/wiki/Ministry_of_Community_Development,_Youth_and_Sports)** 2005 – 2011 Acting: 2004 – 2005Succeeded by[Chan Chun Sing](/wiki/Chan_Chun_Sing)***as Acting Minister*** Preceded by[Yaacob Ibrahim](/wiki/Yaacob_Ibrahim) **[Minister for the Environment and Water Resources](/wiki/Ministry_of_the_Environment_and_Water_Resources)** 2011 – 2015Succeeded by[Masagos Zulkifli](/wiki/Masagos_Zulkifli)**New office** **[Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative](/wiki/Smart_Nation)** 2014 – 2021Succeeded by[Josephine Teo](/wiki/Josephine_Teo)Preceded by[K.
