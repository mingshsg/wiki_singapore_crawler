  "content": "Time zone **Singapore Time** (**SGT**), also known as **Singapore Standard Time** (**SST**), is used in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) and is 8 hours ahead of [Coordinated Universal Time](/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (UTC+08:00). Singapore does not observe [daylight saving time](/wiki/Daylight_saving_time). ## History As part of the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements), Singapore originally adopted the [Malayan Time](/wiki/Time_in_Malaysia), which was GMT+07:30 in 1941. Following the [Japanese occupation](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore), Singapore (known as Syonan-to during this time) adopted the [Tokyo Standard Time](/wiki/Japan_Standard_Time) of GMT+09:00 on 15 February 1942. At the end of [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II) and the return of the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements) to the [British](/wiki/United_Kingdom), Singapore reverted to its pre-war [time zone](/wiki/Time_zone). ### Daylight saving time in Singapore Although Singapore does not currently observe daylight saving time in the traditional sense due to its tropical location, a form of daylight saving time, using a 20-minute offset, was introduced on an annual basis by the [Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_the_Straits_Settlements) in 1933. On 2 July 1920, a bill was intituled as **Daylight Saving Ordinance, 1920**. It is to introduce a 30-minutes offset or seven and a half hour in advance of Greenwich mean time. The bill was read for the first time on 5 July 1920 but was later abandoned. In 1932, Sir [Arnold Percy Robinson](/wiki/Arnold_Percy_Robinson) raised the idea of 20-minute offset after an earlier attempt was abandoned in 1920 which was first proposed by [Sir Laurence Guillemard](/wiki/Laurence_Guillemard) for a 30-minute offset. On 26 September 1932, a bill was intituled as **Daylight Saving Ordinance, 1932**. The Ordinance was passed at a meeting of the Legislative Council held on 5 December 1932 and approved by Sir Cecil Clementi (Governor) on 15 December 1932. Between 1934 and 1935, the **Daylight Saving Ordinance, 1932** was extended throughout both years by Gazette Notifications. The 20-minute offset was formally adopted as [standard time](/wiki/Standard_time) in Singapore in 1936, and on 1 September 1941 the offset was increased to 30 minutes, the same as the 1920 proposal. ### Malaysian standardisation In 1981, [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) decided to [standardise the time](/wiki/Time_in_Malaysia) across its territories to a uniform UTC+08:00. Singapore elected to follow suit, citing business and travel schedules. The change took effect on 1 January 1982, when Singapore moved half an hour forward, on 31 December 1981 at 11:30 pm, creating \"Singapore Standard Time\" (SST). SST is 8 hours ahead of [UTC](/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) and is synchronised with [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing), [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong), [Manila](/wiki/Manila), [Shanghai](/wiki/Shanghai), [Taipei](/wiki/Taipei), [Chongqing](/wiki/Chongqing), [Kunming](/wiki/Kunming), [Bali](/wiki/Bali) and [Perth](/wiki/Perth). ### Timeline Period in useTime offset from [GMT](/wiki/GMT)Reference meridianName of Time (unofficial)(s)NotesPrior to 1 June 1905GMT+06:55:25103° 51' 16\" ELocal Mean Time → Singapore Mean Time (after 1901)1 June 1905 – 31 December 1932GMT+07:00105° 00' 00\" EStandard Zone Time1 January 1933 – 31 December 1935GMT+07:00105° 00' 00\" EMalaya Standard TimeDST observed; clocks shift by 20 minutes1 January 1936 – 31 August 1941GMT+07:20110° 00' 00\" EMalaya Standard TimePermanent DST1 September 1941 – 15 February 1942GMT+07:30112° 30' 00\" EMalaya Standard Time16 February 1942 – 11 September 1945GMT+09:00135° 00' 00\" E[Tokyo Standard Time](/wiki/Japan_Standard_Time)12 September 1945 – 31 December 1981GMT+07:30112° 30' 00\" EMalaya Standard Time → Malaysia Standard Time → Singapore Standard Time (after 1965)1 January 1982 – presentGMT+08:00120° 00' 00\" ESingapore Standard Time ## Legislation Section 51(2) of the Interpretation Act 1965 (2020 Revised Edition) states ““Standard time” means standard time as used in Singapore, namely, 8 hours, or such other period as may from time to time be determined by the President by notification in the Gazette, in advance of Coordinated Universal Time”. ## Timekeeper In the early days, Singapore used a [timeball](/wiki/Time_ball) on Fort Canning and Mount Faber for sailors to check with their chronometers by the falling ball at exactly 1 p.m daily. When the second world war came to Singapore, the Public Works Department (PWD) cut the masts down as the masts formed \"ideal\" markers for artillery. After the war, the timeball became redundant as most ships now had wireless to give them time signals. The Time & Frequency Laboratory of [A*STAR's](/wiki/Agency_for_Science,_Technology_and_Research) National Metrology Centre (NMC) establishes, maintains and disseminates the Coordinated Universal Time of Singapore, UTC (SG) and Singapore Standard Time (SST), the national time scale of Singapore. The difference between UTC+08:00 and SST is never more than 0.9 seconds. NMC maintains five caesium [atomic clocks](/wiki/Atomic_clock) and one hydrogen maser atomic clock. ## IANA time zone database The [IANA time zone database](/wiki/Tz_database) contains one zone for Singapore in the file [zone.tab](/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones): C.C.*Coordinates*TZ*Comment[UTC offset](/wiki/UTC_offset)UTC offset DSTFormatNotesSG+0117+10351Asia/Singaporepeninsular Malaysia, Concordia+08:00+08:00Canonical - Singapore portal - [ASEAN Common Time](/wiki/ASEAN_Common_Time) - Singapore Standard Time - National Metrology Centre\n",
