  "content": "Tofu filled with ground meat or fish **Yong tau foo** ([simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 酿豆腐; [traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 釀豆腐; also spelled *yong tao foo*, *yong tau fu*, *yong tau hu* or *yong tofu*; *ก๋วยเตี๋ยวแคะ* in Thailand) is a [Hakka Chinese dish](/wiki/Hakka_cuisine) consisting primarily of [tofu](/wiki/Tofu) filled with [ground meat](/wiki/Ground_meat) mixture or [fish paste](/wiki/Surimi). Variations on this dish feature vegetables and mushrooms, rather than tofu, stuffed with ground meat or fish paste. Yong tau foo is eaten in numerous ways, either dry with a sauce or served as a [soup dish](/wiki/Asian_soup). It is commonly found in parts of [China](/wiki/China), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand), [Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam), and in cities where there are large [Hakka](/wiki/Hakka_people) populations. ## History The [Hakka people](/wiki/Hakka_people) initiated a southward migration to escape conflicts in [Northern China](/wiki/Northern_China), eventually settling in [Southern China](/wiki/Southern_China) after a series of relocations. Due to the unavailability of [wheat flour](/wiki/Wheat_flour) traditionally used for making [dumpling](/wiki/Dumpling) skins during festivals, they substituted tofu. The Hakka term *nyong*, meaning the act of stuffing, gave rise to the dish known as *yong tau foo*, in which tofu is filled with various ingredients. ## Variations ### Fried Traditional Hakka versions of yong tau foo consist of tofu cubes stuffed and heaped with minced meat (usually lamb or pork) and herbs, then fried until golden brown, or sometimes braised.[*citation needed*] Variations include usage of various condiments, including [eggplants](/wiki/Eggplants), [shiitake mushrooms](/wiki/Shiitake_mushrooms), and [bitter melon](/wiki/Bitter_melon) stuffed with the same meat paste. Traditionally, yong tau foo is served in a clear yellow bean stew along with the bitter melon and shiitake variants. ### Soup Particularly in the Southeast Asian Hakka diaspora, the term *yong tau foo* is used to describe a soup dish that substitutes minced meat with [fish paste](/wiki/Fish_paste). The base of the dish is various forms of tofu stuffed with fish paste, but it is now common to stuff vegetables like bitter melon, [okra](/wiki/Okra), and [chilis](/wiki/Chili_pepper) with fish paste as well, and the soup can include other ingredients like [fish balls](/wiki/Fish_ball), [crab sticks](/wiki/Crab_stick), [cuttlefish](/wiki/Cuttlefish), and [sausages](/wiki/Sausage). The foods are then sliced into bite-size pieces, cooked briefly in boiling broth and then served either in the broth as soup or with the broth in a separate bowl (\"dry\"). The dish is eaten with [chopsticks](/wiki/Chopsticks) and a [soup spoon](/wiki/Soup_spoon) and can be eaten by itself or served with a bowl of [steamed rice](/wiki/Steamed_rice), [noodles](/wiki/Noodle) or [rice vermicelli](/wiki/Rice_vermicelli). Another variation of this dish would be to serve it with *[laksa](/wiki/Laksa)* gravy or [curry](/wiki/Curry) sauce. Essential accompaniments are a spicy, vinegary chili sauce, originally made with red [fermented bean curd](/wiki/Fermented_bean_curd) and distantly similar in taste to [Sriracha sauce](/wiki/Sriracha_sauce), and a distinctive brown [sweet bean sauce](/wiki/Sweet_bean_sauce) or [hoisin sauce](/wiki/Hoisin_sauce) for dipping. ### Regional variations Yong tau foo exhibits diverse regional variations across Malaysia, with different areas offering their own unique interpretations of the dish. In the [Klang Valley](/wiki/Klang_Valley), particularly in [Ampang, Selangor](/wiki/Ampang,_Selangor), which is situated just outside [Kuala Lumpur](/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur), yong tau foo has become a signature local specialty. Ampang is often associated with the more traditional version of the dish, which features an assortment of tofu, vegetables, and fish paste, served either in a soup or dry with a variety of dipping sauces. In contrast, the town of [Tawau](/wiki/Tawau) in [Sabah](/wiki/Sabah) has developed its own distinctive take on yong tau foo. The Tawau version is notably [deep fried](/wiki/Deep_frying) and is often enjoyed with [sambal](/wiki/Sambal) and fried [mee hoon](/wiki/Rice_vermicelli), making it a popular dinner option. This fried variation is colloquially known as \"yum-yum,\" named after the original establishment that popularised it. Beyond the yong tau foo itself, the dish is frequently accompanied by chopped fried chicken, [bishop's nose](/wiki/Pygostyle) and chicken [gizzards](/wiki/Gizzard), adding extra flavor and texture. The Tawau-style yong tau foo has since grown in popularity, spreading to other parts of Sabah, where it has become a local delicacy. Thailand version of Yong Tau Foo or Yen Ta Fo (in Thai) is a result of mixing of Hakka original Yong Tau Foo with Chaozhou (Teochew) style red fermented bean curd. Now the stuffed bean curd is often dropped, but Thais still keep the fermented bean curd. Later on, more pinkish ingredients have been added to the dish such as tomato or even food coloring. So, modern Thai Yen Ta Fo is always pinkish and rarely find the stuffed bean curd. In Thailand, *yentafo* is a variation of yong tau foo that features a distinct pink-colored broth, created by the use of [fermented bean paste](/wiki/Fermented_bean_paste) and, sometimes, tomato. Modern Thai Yong Tau Foo might enhance the color with the addition of food coloring, giving the dish its unique pink appearance. In Vietnam, particularly in southern regions, a similar dish known as *khổ qua cà ớt* is popular. It consists of fish paste, locally referred to as [chả cá](/wiki/Ch%E1%BA%A3), which is stuffed into bitter melon, large chili peppers, fried tofu, eggplants, or tomatoes before being fried. This dish can be enjoyed on its own, dipped in a sauce, or served in a bowl with broth. ## Gallery - Food portal - [List of Chinese soups](/wiki/List_of_Chinese_soups) - [List of soups](/wiki/List_of_soups) - [List of tofu dishes](/wiki/List_of_tofu_dishes) Part of a series on[Chinese cuisine](/wiki/Chinese_cuisine)[Regional cuisines](/wiki/Chinese_regional_cuisine)Four Great Traditions - [Chuan (Sichuan)](/wiki/Sichuan_cuisine) - [Lu (Shandong)](/wiki/Shandong_cuisine) - [Yue (Guangdong)](/wiki/Cantonese_cuisine) - [Huaiyang (Jiangsu)](/wiki/Huaiyang_cuisine) Eight Great Traditions (+all above) - [Anhui](/wiki/Anhui_cuisine) - [Fujian](/wiki/Fujian_cuisine) - [Hunan](/wiki/Hunan_cuisine) - [Zhejiang](/wiki/Zhejiang_cuisine) Ten Great Traditions (+all above) - [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing_cuisine) - [Shanghai](/wiki/Shanghai_cuisine) Twelve Great Traditions (+all above) - [Henan](/wiki/Henan_cuisine) - [Shaanxi](/wiki/Shaanxi_cuisine) Fourteen Great Traditions (+all above) - [Hubei](/wiki/Hubei_cuisine) - [Liaoning](/wiki/Liaoning_cuisine) Sixteen Great Traditions (+all above) - [Tianjin](/wiki/Tianjin_cuisine) - [Yunnan](/wiki/Yunnan_cuisine) New Eight Great Traditions - [Gansu](/wiki/Gansu_cuisine) - [Hangzhou](/wiki/Zhejiang_cuisine#Style) - [Jilin](/wiki/Jilin_cuisine) - [Liaoning](/wiki/Liaoning_cuisine) - [Ningbo](/wiki/Zhejiang_cuisine#Style) - [Shaanxi](/wiki/Shaanxi_cuisine) - [Shanghai](/wiki/Shanghai_cuisine) - [Shanxi](/wiki/Shanxi_cuisine) Beijing and the vicinity - [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing_cuisine) - [Imperial](/wiki/Chinese_imperial_cuisine) - [Aristocrat](/wiki/Chinese_aristocrat_cuisine) - [Tianjin](/wiki/Tianjin_cuisine) Other regional styles - [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_cuisine) - [Guangxi](/wiki/Guangxi_cuisine) - [Guizhou](/wiki/Guizhou_cuisine) - [Hainan](/wiki/Hainan_cuisine) - [Haipai](/wiki/Haipai_cuisine) - [Hakka](/wiki/Hakka_cuisine) - [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong_cuisine) - [Jiangxi](/wiki/Jiangxi_cuisine) - [Macanese](/wiki/Macanese_cuisine) - [Manchu](/wiki/Manchu_cuisine) - [Northeastern](/wiki/Northeastern_Chinese_cuisine) - [Putian (Henghwa)](/wiki/Putian_cuisine) - [Qinghai](/wiki/Qinghai_cuisine) - [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwanese_cuisine) - [Tibetan](/wiki/Tibetan_cuisine) - [Xinjiang](/wiki/Xinjiang_cuisine) Overseas cuisine - [Australia](/wiki/Australian_Chinese_cuisine) - [Britain](/wiki/British_Chinese_cuisine) - [Burma](/wiki/Burmese_Chinese_cuisine) - [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodian_Chinese_cuisine) - [Canada](/wiki/Canadian_Chinese_cuisine) - [Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean_Chinese_cuisine) - [Philippines](/wiki/Filipino_Chinese_cuisine) - [India](/wiki/Indian_Chinese_cuisine) - [Indonesia](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian_cuisine) - [Japan](/wiki/Japanese_Chinese_cuisine) - [Latin America](/wiki/Chinese_Latin_American_cuisine) - [Perú](/wiki/Chifa) - [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rican_Chinese_cuisine) - [Korea](/wiki/Korean_Chinese_cuisine) - [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese_cuisine) - [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand_Chinese_cuisine) - [Pakistan](/wiki/Pakistani_Chinese_cuisine) - [Singapore](/wiki/Singaporean_cuisine#Chinese) - [United States](/wiki/American_Chinese_cuisine) Religious cuisines - [Buddhist](/wiki/Chinese_Buddhist_cuisine) - [Islamic](/wiki/Chinese_Islamic_cuisine) - [Taoist](/wiki/Taoist_diet) Ingredients and types of food - [Main dishes](/wiki/List_of_Chinese_dishes) - [Desserts](/wiki/Chinese_desserts) - [Noodles](/wiki/Chinese_noodles) [Preparation and cooking](/wiki/Chinese_cooking_techniques) - [Stir frying](/wiki/Stir_frying) - [Double steaming](/wiki/Double_steaming) - [Red cooking](/wiki/Red_cooking) See also - [Customs and etiquette](/wiki/Customs_and_etiquette_in_Chinese_dining) - [List of Chinese desserts](/wiki/List_of_Chinese_desserts) - [List of Chinese dishes](/wiki/List_of_Chinese_dishes) - [List of Chinese restaurants](/wiki/List_of_Chinese_restaurants) - [List of restaurants in China](/wiki/List_of_restaurants_in_China) - Asia portal - China portal - Taiwan portal - Hong Kong portal - Singapore portal - Malaysia portal - v - t - e\n",
