It is bordered by [Ghim Moh](/wiki/Ghim_Moh) to the north, [Kent Ridge](/wiki/Kent_Ridge) to the south and southeast, [one-north](/wiki/One-north) and [Queenstown](/wiki/Queenstown,_Singapore) to the east, [Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth,_Singapore) and [Holland Village](/wiki/Holland_Village,_Singapore) to the northeast [Clementi](/wiki/Clementi,_Singapore) to the west and [West Coast](/wiki/West_Coast,_Singapore) to the southwest. It is often a noted location due to the sheer number of [educational facilities](/wiki/Educational_institution) it holds, while lying in a zone between the [Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore) and near industrial zone in the vicinity of [Jurong](/wiki/Jurong). ## Etymology and history The name \"Dover\" is from the Celtic word meaning \"The Waters\", alluding to the [English Channel](/wiki/English_Channel). Medway Park, for instance, is named after the [River Medway](/wiki/River_Medway), which marks the middle of Kent. [Kent](/wiki/Kent) is the [English county](/wiki/English_county) where the town of [Dover](/wiki/Dover), the namesake is located.[*citation needed*] ## Roads in Dover - Dover Road - Dover Crescent - Dover Close East - Dover Avenue - Dover Drive - Dover Rise ## Transport There are two [Mass Rapid Transit](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) (MRT) stations which are in proximity to Dover. One is [Dover MRT station](/wiki/Dover_MRT_station), which is EW22 on the [East West MRT line](/wiki/East_West_MRT_line), and the other is [Buona Vista MRT station](/wiki/Buona_Vista_MRT_station) which is EW21/CC22. However, neither MRT station is situated near the heart of Dover. The former is located next to [Singapore Polytechnic](/wiki/Singapore_Polytechnic), whilst the latter at the intersection of [North Buona Vista Road](/wiki/North_Buona_Vista_Road) and Commonwealth Avenue. A portion of most residents drop at Dover MRT station ([East West line](/wiki/East_West_MRT_line)) and transfer to a bus (14, 74, 105, 106, 166 or 185), while another portion drop at [Buona Vista MRT station](/wiki/Buona_Vista_MRT_station) (East West line and [Circle line](/wiki/Circle_Line_(Singapore))), takes a kilometre walk to Dover or transfer to buses 14, 74 or 196. Alternately, [one-north MRT station](/wiki/One-north_MRT_station) is within walking distance of the eastern end of Dover, although not being located in it. ## Education Dover is known for having many schools and education institutions in its neighbourhood and vicinity. - Primary schools - [Fairfield Methodist Primary School](/wiki/Fairfield_Methodist_Primary_School) - Secondary schools - [Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)](/wiki/Anglo-Chinese_School_(Independent)) - [Fairfield Methodist Secondary School](/wiki/Fairfield_Methodist_Secondary_School) - [Nan Hua High School](/wiki/Nan_Hua_High_School) - [New Town Secondary School](/wiki/New_Town_Secondary_School) - [NUS High School of Math and Science](/wiki/NUS_High_School_of_Math_and_Science) - [School of Science and Technology, Singapore](/wiki/School_of_Science_and_Technology,_Singapore) - Higher institutions of learning - [National University of Singapore](/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore) (NUS) (Kent Ridge) - [Singapore Institute of Technology](/wiki/Singapore_Institute_of_Technology) (SIT) (Dover Campus, previously occupied by [Singapore University of Technology and Design](/wiki/Singapore_University_of_Technology_and_Design) till 2015) - [Singapore Polytechnic](/wiki/Singapore_Polytechnic) - [Anglo-Chinese Junior College](/wiki/Anglo-Chinese_Junior_College) - [INSEAD](/wiki/INSEAD) - International schools - [Dover Court International School](/wiki/Dover_Court_International_School) - Japanese Secondary School (Clementi) - Norwegian Supplementary School - [United World College of South East Asia](/wiki/United_World_College_of_South_East_Asia) - Other education institutions - [Ministry of Education (Singapore)](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)) - Singapore portal\n",
