  "content": "Church in Singapore **Holy Trinity Church** is an [Anglican](/wiki/Anglican_church) [church](/wiki/Church_(building)) on Hamilton Road, near [Little India](/wiki/Little_India,_Singapore), Singapore. ## Overview The church was built by the Fuzhou and Hokkien congregations after the government took over the original St Peter's Church site at Stamford Road in 1937 to construct the [Singapore National Library](/wiki/Singapore_National_Library). The church continued to host two congregations with separate Fuzhou and Hokkien services led by two priests. The Fuzhou congregation became Singapore's first Chinese-speaking Anglican parish in 1958. The Hokkien congregation was merged with the English-speaking Good Shepherd parish from 1963 then returned to become part of the joint Fuzhou-Hokkien Holy Trinity Parish in 1984. There are currently two timings for services on Sundays at Holy Trinity Church. English services are at 8:45 am and 11 am, Chinese Fuzhou services are at 8:45 am and Chinese Hokkien services are at 11 am. This article on an Anglican church is a stub.
