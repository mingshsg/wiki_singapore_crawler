  "content": "Singaporean politician (born 1968) **Ng Chee Meng**[a] [PJG](/wiki/Pingat_Jasa_Gemilang_(Tentera)) [PPA(E) PPA(G)](/wiki/Pingat_Pentadbiran_Awam_(Tentera)) [PBS](/wiki/Long_Service_Medal_(Military)_(Singapore)) (born 8 August 1968) is a Singaporean politician, [union](/wiki/Trade_union) leader and former [lieutenant-general](/wiki/Lieutenant-general). A member of the governing [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP), he has been the secretary-general of the [National Trades Union Congress](/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress) (NTUC) since 2018 and the [Member of Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore#Members_of_Parliament) (MP) for [Jalan Kayu Single Member Constituency](/wiki/Jalan_Kayu_Single_Member_Constituency) (SMC) since 2025. He had previously represented the Punggol North division of [Pasir Ris–Punggol Group Representation Constituency](/wiki/Pasir_Ris%E2%80%93Punggol_Group_Representation_Constituency) (GRC) between 2015 and 2020. Prior to entering politics, Ng served in the [Republic of Singapore Air Force](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force) under the [Singapore Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces) (SAF) between 1986 and 2015, and held the appointments of [Chief of Air Force](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force) between 2009 and 2013 and [Chief of Defence Force](/wiki/Chief_of_Defence_Force_(Singapore)) between 2013 and 2015. He joined politics in 2015, and left the SAF in order to contest the [general election that year](/wiki/2015_Singaporean_general_election). During his first stint as an MP, Ng served as [Minister for Education (Schools)](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)) between 2015 and 2018 and [Minister in the Prime Minister's Office](/wiki/Prime_Minister%27s_Office_(Singapore)) between 2018 and 2020. In the [2020 general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election), he led the PAP team for [Sengkang GRC](/wiki/Sengkang_Group_Representation_Constituency); however, it lost to the opposition [Workers' Party](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Singapore)) (WP). In 2020, Ng was co-opted into the PAP's [Central Executive Committee](/wiki/Central_Executive_Committee_(People%27s_Action_Party)) (CEC) despite losing his MP seat that year. During his time outside of political office, he remained the Secretary-General of NTUC and was a key proponent of a deal between [Income Insurance](/wiki/Income_Insurance) and [Allianz](/wiki/Allianz), which was ultimately called off amid intense public backlash. Ng made a political comeback in the [2025 general election](/wiki/2025_Singaporean_general_election), winning the newly formed Jalan Kayu SMC by only 809 votes against WP candidate [Andre Low](/wiki/Andre_Low). ## Education Ng was educated at [The Chinese High School](/wiki/The_Chinese_High_School) and [Hwa Chong Junior College](/wiki/Hwa_Chong_Junior_College), and was awarded the Singapore Armed Forces Overseas Training Award (Graduating) in 1987. He completed a [Bachelor of Science](/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science) in [electrical engineering](/wiki/Electrical_engineering) at the [United States Air Force Academy](/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Academy) in 1991, and graduated from the [Singapore Command and Staff College](/wiki/Singapore_Command_and_Staff_College) in 1999. In 2002, he obtained a [Master of Arts](/wiki/Master_of_Arts) in international relations from [The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy](/wiki/The_Fletcher_School_of_Law_and_Diplomacy) at [Tufts University](/wiki/Tufts_University). ## Military career Ng enlisted into the [Singapore Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces) (SAF) in December 1986 and was a [fighter pilot](/wiki/Fighter_pilot) in the [Republic of Singapore Air Force](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force) (RSAF). During his military career, among the appointments he held were: Commanding Officer, [144 Squadron](/wiki/144_Squadron,_Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force); Commander, [Changi Air Base](/wiki/Changi_Air_Base); Deputy Head, Joint Communications and Information Systems Department; Head, Air Plans; Director, Joint Operations; Deputy Chief of Air Force. He was also Military Private Secretary to the [Minister for Defence](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Singapore)#List_of_ministers) from December 1995 to July 1996. On 10 December 2009, Ng succeeded his elder brother, [Ng Chee Khern](/wiki/Ng_Chee_Khern), as the Chief of Air Force. He was succeeded by [Hoo Cher Mou](/wiki/Hoo_Cher_Mou) on 25 March 2013, after his appointment as [Chief of Defence Force](/wiki/Chief_of_Defence_Force_(Singapore)) on 27 March 2013. He was promoted from the rank of [Major-General](/wiki/Major-General) to [Lieutenant-General](/wiki/Lieutenant-General) on 27 June 2013. Ng was the second general from the RSAF to be appointed as Chief of Defence Force, after [Bey Soo Khiang](/wiki/Bey_Soo_Khiang) in 1995. Ng chaired the organising committee for the [state funeral](/wiki/Death_of_Lee_Kuan_Yew) of Singapore's first [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore), [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew), from 23 to 29 March 2015. He also led the first round of the [vigil guard](/wiki/Vigil_guard) who stood guard during [Lee's lying in state](/wiki/Death_of_Lee_Kuan_Yew#Lying_in_state) in [Parliament House](/wiki/Parliament_House,_Singapore) from 25 to 28 March. Ng retired from the SAF on 18 August 2015 and was succeeded by [Perry Lim](/wiki/Perry_Lim) as Chief of Defence Force. ## Political career ### 2015–2020 On 18 August 2015, Ng announced that he would enter politics after retiring from the [Singapore Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces) (SAF). On 22 August 2015, the [PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) announced that Ng would be part of the six-member PAP team for [Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC](/wiki/Pasir_Ris%E2%80%93Punggol_Group_Representation_Constituency) in the same year's [general election](/wiki/2015_Singaporean_general_election). The PAP team won with 72.89% of the vote. Ng was subsequently appointed Acting Minister for Education (Schools), and served as Second Minister for Transport, and Minister for Education (Schools) concurrently from 1 November 2016 to 30 April 2018. On 23 April 2018, Ng joined the [National Trades Union Congress](/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress) (NTUC) and was appointed Deputy Secretary-General. He was then appointed Minister in the Prime Minister's Office on 1 May 2018. On 22 May 2018, Ng was elected Secretary-General of the NTUC by the NTUC Central Committee. ### Defeat in Sengkang In the [2020 general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election), Ng lost his seat in Parliament after the PAP team he led lost to that of the WP, led by [He Ting Ru](/wiki/He_Ting_Ru), in [Sengkang GRC](/wiki/Sengkang_Group_Representation_Constituency) by a margin of 4.26%. He also left his positions in the cabinet, but remained Secretary-General of [NTUC](/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress). On 19 November 2020, he was co-opted into the PAP's [Central Executive Committee](/wiki/Central_Executive_Committee_(PAP)) (CEC) despite not being a Member of Parliament (MP). This was thought to be due to his role as the Secretary-General of NTUC, which would allow it to be represented in the CEC. On 27 March 2022, Ng was removed from the PAP team for Sengkang GRC. On 5 August 2024, Ng, in a joint statement with NTUC president K Thanaletchimi, endorsed a deal to sell a controlling 51% stake in NTUC Enterprise subsidiary [Income Insurance](/wiki/Income_Insurance) to [Allianz](/wiki/Allianz). The statement mentioned that the NTUC Central Committee, which Ng is part of, supported the deal after \"full and serious consideration\". The Singapore Government announced on 14 October 2024 that it had blocked the deal. The Central Committee later stated that they were unaware of a controversial plan to reduce Income's [share capital](/wiki/Share_capital) and return $1.85 billion in cash to shareholders within the first three years after completion of the transaction. ### Return to Parliament In March and April 2025, Ng was spotted in [Fernvale](/wiki/Fernvale,_Singapore) and was later seen making walkabouts and assisting Senior Minister [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) and [Gan Thiam Poh](/wiki/Gan_Thiam_Poh) in a [Meet-the-People Session](/wiki/Meet-the-People_Sessions) in Fernvale, an indication that he might run in the newly formed [Jalan Kayu SMC](/wiki/Jalan_Kayu_Single_Member_Constituency) in the upcoming [2025 general election](/wiki/2025_Singaporean_general_election). On 19 April, it was announced that Ng would contest said SMC in the upcoming general election. He proceeded to narrowly defeat [Andre Low](/wiki/Andre_Low) from the WP with 51.47% of the vote against Low's 48.53%, a majority of just 809 votes. Three days later after his win, Ng announced that he had asked Prime Minister [Lawrence Wong](/wiki/Lawrence_Wong) not to offer him any [cabinet](/wiki/Second_Lawrence_Wong_Cabinet) positions to allow him to focus on his duties as an MP and Secretary-General of NTUC. This request came amid heightened public scrutiny following allegations about his conduct during a [Ministry of Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education,_Singapore) (MOE) dialogue session in 2017, where he was accused of aggressive and patronising behavior towards teachers. Ng issued a statement on 6 May, stating that he \"sincerely [apologised]\" and that he \"could have handled the situation better\". Simultaneously, photos emerged online showing Ng dining with Su Haijin, one of the individuals who was later convicted in a [massive money laundering case](/wiki/2023_Singapore_money_laundering_case) involving assets worth [S$](/wiki/Singapore_dollar)3 billion. Ng claimed that he had no further interactions with Su after learning about the police investigation. Prior to his own request, a petition calling for his exclusion from the [Cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Singapore) was made on [Change.org](/wiki/Change.org), garnering over 25,000 signatures. ## Personal life Ng is married to Michelle Lim Bee Leng. They have two daughters, Elisabeth and Sara. Ng has an elder brother, [Ng Chee Khern](/wiki/Ng_Chee_Khern), a former [major-general](/wiki/Major-general) who served as [Chief of Air Force](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force#List_of_chiefs_of_Air_Force) between 2006 and 2009, and a younger brother, [Ng Chee Peng](/wiki/Ng_Chee_Peng), a former two-star [rear-admiral](/wiki/Rear-admiral) who served as [Chief of Navy](/wiki/Chief_of_Navy_(Singapore)) between 2011 and 2014. ## Awards and decorations - [Public Administration Medal (Military) (Bronze)](/wiki/Pingat_Pentadbiran_Awam_(Tentera)), in 2005. - [Public Administration Medal (Military) (Gold)](/wiki/Pingat_Pentadbiran_Awam_(Tentera)), in 2011. - [Long Service Medal (Military)](/wiki/Long_Service_Medal_(Military)_(Singapore)), in 2012. - [Meritorious Service Medal (Military)](/wiki/Pingat_Jasa_Gemilang_(Tentera)), in 2015 - [Singapore Armed Forces Long Service and Good Conduct (10 Years) Medal](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_Long_Service_and_Good_Conduct_(10_Years)_Medal) with 15 year clasp - [Singapore Armed Forces Long Service and Good Conduct (20 Years) Medal](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_Long_Service_and_Good_Conduct_(20_Years)_Medal) - [Singapore Armed Forces Good Service Medal](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_Good_Service_Medal) - Knight Grand Cross of the Most Noble [Order of the Crown](/wiki/Order_of_the_Crown_of_Thailand) - [Bintang Swa Bhuwana Paksa Utama](/wiki/Orders,_decorations,_and_medals_of_Indonesia) (1st Class) - [The Most Exalted Order of Paduka Keberanian Laila Terbilang](/wiki/Order_of_Paduka_Keberanian_Laila_Terbilang) (1st Class) - Knight Grand Cross of the Most Exalted [Order of the White Elephant](/wiki/Order_of_the_White_Elephant) - Darjah Panglima Gagah Angkatan Tentera (1st Degree) - [Legion of Honour (Commander)](/wiki/Legion_of_Honour) ## Notes and references - Ng Chee Meng on Prime Minister's Office Political officesPreceded by[Heng Swee Keat](/wiki/Heng_Swee_Keat)***as Minister for Education*** **[Minister for Education (Schools)](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore))** 2016–2018 Acting: 2015 – 2016 Served alongside: **[Ong Ye Kung](/wiki/Ong_Ye_Kung) (Higher Education and Skills)**Succeeded by[Ong Ye Kung](/wiki/Ong_Ye_Kung)***as Minister for Education*** Preceded by[Chan Chun Sing](/wiki/Chan_Chun_Sing) [Josephine Teo](/wiki/Josephine_Teo) **[Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office](/wiki/Prime_Minister%27s_Office_(Singapore))** 2018–2020 Served alongside: **[Indranee Rajah](/wiki/Indranee_Rajah)**Succeeded by[Maliki Osman](/wiki/Maliki_Osman) [Tan See Leng](/wiki/Tan_See_Leng)[Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore)Preceded by[Zainal bin Sapari](/wiki/Zainal_bin_Sapari) [Teo Chee Hean](/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean) [Penny Low](/wiki/Penny_Low) [Gan Thiam Poh](/wiki/Gan_Thiam_Poh) [Teo Ser Luck](/wiki/Teo_Ser_Luck) [Janil Puthucheary](/wiki/Janil_Puthucheary) **Member of Parliament for [Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC](/wiki/Pasir_Ris%E2%80%93Punggol_GRC)** 2015–2020 Served alongside: **[Zainal bin Sapari](/wiki/Zainal_bin_Sapari), [Teo Chee Hean](/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean), [Teo Ser Luck](/wiki/Teo_Ser_Luck), [Sun Xueling](/wiki/Sun_Xueling), [Janil Puthucheary](/wiki/Janil_Puthucheary)**Succeeded by[Sharael Taha](/wiki/Sharael_Taha) [Desmond Tan](/wiki/Desmond_Tan_(politician)) [Teo Chee Hean](/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean) [Yeo Wan Ling](/wiki/Yeo_Wan_Ling) [Janil Puthucheary](/wiki/Janil_Puthucheary)**New constituency** **Member of Parliament for [Jalan Kayu SMC](/wiki/Jalan_Kayu_SMC)** 2025–present**Incumbent**Trade union officesPreceded by[Chan Chun Sing](/wiki/Chan_Chun_Sing) **Secretary-General of the [National Trades Union Congress](/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress)** 2018–present**Incumbent**Military officesPreceded byMajor-General [Ng Chee Khern](/wiki/Ng_Chee_Khern) **Chief of the [Republic of Singapore Air Force](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force)** 10 December 2009–25 March 2013Succeeded byBrigadier-General [Hoo Cher Mou](/wiki/Hoo_Cher_Mou)Preceded byLieutenant-General [Neo Kian Hong](/wiki/Neo_Kian_Hong) **8th [Chief of Defence Force](/wiki/Chief_of_Defence_Force_(Singapore))** 27 March 2013–18 August 2015Succeeded byMajor-General [Perry Lim](/wiki/Perry_Lim)\n",
