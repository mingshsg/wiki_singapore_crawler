At the time, many people resided in overcrowded shophouses and squatter settlements, resulting in widespread disease and lack of hygiene and sanitation. The SIT organisation had brought in professional architects and general contractors to resolve this large social problem, with the ultimate goal of building affordable public housing for the common population of Singapore. ## Japanese Occupation of Singapore Following the [Japanese Occupation of Singapore](/wiki/Japanese_Occupation_of_Singapore) in 1942, work at SIT came to a standstill with all its senior officers as prisoners-of-war, with a large number of the subordinate staff, however, worked for the Japanese administration. The Kenpeitai came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of War in Tokyo. There were about 200 regular Kenpeitai in Singapore but 1,000 auxiliaries were recruited from the army. The Kenpeitai took over a three-storey SIT residential flat which was located at the intersection of Smith Street and New Bridge Road to operate as one of their branches known as the Kenpeitai West District Branch. An [Old YMCA Building](/wiki/Old_YMCA_Building) at [Stamford Road](/wiki/Stamford_Road) formed the [Kenpeitai East District Branch](/wiki/Kenpeitai_East_District_Branch) and also the Kenpeitai headquarters. The Kenpeitai jail was situated at the [Outram Prison](/wiki/Outram_Prison) and another branch at the Central Police Station. The Kenpeitai would operated in these buildings in Singapore until 1945. ## Demolition The SIT flat buildings (known as New Bridge Estate) along the Smith Street, including the one which once housed Kenpeitai West District Branch, were demolished in 1975, A commercial building New Bridge Centre was completed on its former site in 1980.\n",
