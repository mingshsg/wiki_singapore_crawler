  "content": "Former electoral constituency in Singapore **Pasir Ris Group Representation Constituency** was a four-member [group representation constituency](/wiki/Group_representation_constituency) (GRC) in [eastern](/wiki/East_Region,_Singapore) [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). ## History A PAP team led by [Teo Chee Hean](/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean) won the contest for Pasir Ris GRC during the [1997 general election](/wiki/1997_Singaporean_general_election). The GRC was split into Pasir Ris Loyang, Pasir Ris Elias, Pasir Ris Central, Pasir Ris South divisions by the PAP. In [2001 General Election](/wiki/2001_Singaporean_general_election), this GRC absorbed 3 wards in [Punggol](/wiki/Punggol) areas, while 3 of the 4 existing member wards in [Pasir Ris](/wiki/Pasir_Ris) were consolidated into 2 wards. With such enlargement, this GRC was renamed into [Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC](/wiki/Pasir_Ris%E2%80%93Punggol_GRC) and expanded to a 5 members GRC. Since then, it again expanded to 6 members GRC during [2006 General Election](/wiki/2006_Singaporean_general_election) until the [2020 General Election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election). ## Members of Parliament YearDivisionMembers of ParliamentParty**Formation**(/wiki/1997_Singaporean_general_election) - Pasir Ris Loyang - Pasir Ris Elias - Pasir Ris Central - Pasir Ris South - [Teo Chee Hean](/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean) - [Charles Chong](/wiki/Charles_Chong) - [Ahmad Magad](/wiki/Ahmad_Magad) - Ong Kian Min [PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)**Constituency abolished (2001)** ## Electoral results Note: The [Elections Department](/wiki/Elections_Department_Singapore) does not include rejected votes when calculating the vote shares of candidates.
