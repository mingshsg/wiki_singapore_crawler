  "content": "Political party in Singapore The **People's Front** (abbr. **PF**) was a short-lived [Singaporean](/wiki/Singapore) political party that was registered on 21 May 1971 where some members from a faction of [Barisan Sosialis](/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis) (BS) that was mostly Chinese-speaking had decided to resign from BS. However, their existence was only prominent in [1972 election](/wiki/1972_Singaporean_general_election) because by November 1976, most of its members had instead chose to join [Workers' Party](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_of_Singapore) where the [1976 general election](/wiki/1976_Singaporean_general_election) was held in December 1976. Eventually after 1976 general election, the few remaining party members who participated had decided to join [United Front](/wiki/United_Front_(Singapore)) instead, and the party was left dormant. On 7 August 2025, the Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs sought proof of PF's existence along with 13 other political parties due to its failure to comply with the [Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act 2021](/wiki/Foreign_Interference_(Countermeasures)_Act_2021). If there is no proof of existence provided to the Singapore Government within 3 months, the Registrar of Societies will deem the party as officially defunct. - Background of People's Front (Singapore) This article about a Singaporean political party is a stub.
