  "content": "Cinema chain in Singapore **Golden Village** is a cinema operator in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). It also is a partner of [Orange Sky Golden Harvest](/wiki/Orange_Sky_Golden_Harvest), a [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong)-based film production company. Established in 1992 as a joint venture between Golden Harvest and [Village Roadshow](/wiki/Village_Roadshow), the company operates 17 multiplexes and cineplexes across Singapore. It introduced Asia’s first multiplex at [Yishun](/wiki/Yishun) in the same year the company was established. Golden Village Pictures, the film distribution division of Golden Village, has distributed titles from [Village Roadshow Pictures](/wiki/Village_Roadshow_Pictures), including [*The Matrix* trilogy](/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)), *[Charlie and The Chocolate Factory](/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_(film))*, *[Happy Feet](/wiki/Happy_Feet)*, and *[The Lego Movie](/wiki/The_Lego_Movie)* in Singapore. Additionally, the company distributes acquired films in regional and global markets.[*citation needed*] ## History Golden Village opened its first cinema in Singapore on May 28, 1992 with the Yishun 10 complex, marking the introduction of Asia’s first [multiplex](/wiki/Multiplex_(movie_theater)). In 1998, the company expanded with the launch of GV Grand at [Great World City](/wiki/Great_World_City), featuring six screens, including a luxury Gold Class hall. During the early 2000s, one of the halls was converted into an [IMAX theatre](/wiki/IMAX_theatre), but closed in 2004 due to low patronage. The company also operated a location at Eastpoint, which was closed in 2002. In October 2006, Golden Village opened a multiplex at [VivoCity](/wiki/VivoCity), the largest multiplex in Singapore, featuring 15 screens, including three Gold Class screens and GV Max, one of the largest cinema auditoriums in the country. Its current flagship cineplex is located at Suntec City, with 11 screens, including three Gold Class screens, occupying the space previously used by [WE Cinemas](/wiki/WE_Cinemas) and The Rock Auditorium. In June 2017, mm2 Asia, a Singaporean-based media company, announced its intention to acquire [Village Roadshow](/wiki/Village_Roadshow)’s 50% stake in Golden Village. However, the acquisition did not proceed as Village Roadshow failed to get approval from [Orange Sky Golden Harvest](/wiki/Orange_Sky_Golden_Harvest). Subsequently, in October 2017, Orange Sky Golden Harvest acquired Village Roadshow’s stake, becoming the only owner of Golden Village. In November 2024, Golden Village opened its 15th outlet, GV Bugis+, featuring eight halls, including two Gold Class Express halls, and a Spanish-Mexican dining concept named Azul. As of 2025, Golden Village operates 17 multiplexes across [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), continuing to be the largest operator in the country’s cinema industry. ## Cineplexes and multiplexes As of 2025, Golden Village operates 17 cinemas with 126 screens in Singapore. All cinemas that opened before 2000 have been refurbished. [GV@Capitol](/wiki/Capitol_Theatre,_Singapore) screens movies from December to March every year. ### Current locations This section **does not cite any sources**.
