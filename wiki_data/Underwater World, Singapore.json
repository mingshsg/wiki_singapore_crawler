It was opened on 13 May 1991 and closed on 26 June 2016. ## History The oceanarium was developed by the [Western Australian Development Corporation](/wiki/Western_Australian_Development_Corporation) in the late 1980s. It opened to the public on 13 May 1991 and was sold to private investors a year later. It had more than 2,500 [marine animals](/wiki/Marine_animal) of 250 species from different regions of the world. The oceanarium was mostly underground and it was owned by the [Haw Par Corporation](/wiki/Haw_Par_Corporation). The Underwater World's ticket included admission to the Dolphin Lagoon at Palawan Beach. It re-opened on 23 February 2010 after a revamp of several attractions within the park. In August 2014 the organizations Wildlife Watcher Singapore, in collaboration with [Sea Shepherd Conservation Society](/wiki/Sea_Shepherd_Conservation_Society), reported sub-standard living conditions for the animals. The pink dolphins have since been rehoused in [Chimelong Ocean Kingdom](/wiki/Chimelong_Ocean_Kingdom), an oceanarium in [Zhuhai](/wiki/Zhuhai), China. ## Closure On 6 June 2016, it was announced by operator Haw Par that the venue would close on 26th of that month. Its pink dolphins, fur seals and otters had been transferred to [Chimelong Ocean Kingdom](/wiki/Chimelong_Ocean_Kingdom) in Zhuhai, China the week before the announcement. - [Jurong Bird Park](/wiki/Jurong_Bird_Park) - [Marine Life Park](/wiki/Marine_Life_Park) - [Singapore Zoo](/wiki/Singapore_Zoo) - [Van Kleef Aquarium](/wiki/Van_Kleef_Aquarium) - Media related to Underwater World, Singapore at Wikimedia Commons - Official website\n",
