  "content": "Deep-fried pastry of Chinese origin ***Youtiao*** ([traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 油條; [simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 油条; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *Yóutiáo*), known in Southern China as **yu char kway**, is a long golden-brown [deep-fried](/wiki/Deep-fried) strip of wheat flour [dough](/wiki/Dough) of [Chinese origin](/wiki/Chinese_cuisine) and (by a variety of other names) also popular in other [East](/wiki/East_Asia) and [Southeast Asian](/wiki/Southeast_Asia) cuisines. Conventionally, *youtiao* are lightly salted and easily separated by hand. *Youtiao* are normally eaten at breakfast as an accompaniment for [rice congee](/wiki/Congee), [soy milk](/wiki/Doujiang) or cow's [milk](/wiki/Milk) blended with sugar. ***Youtiao*** may also be known as a **Chinese [cruller](/wiki/Cruller)**, **Chinese oil stick**, **Chinese donut [sticks]**, and **fried breadstick**, among others. In other Asian countries, they may also be called *bicho, you char kway, cakwe, cakoi, kueh, kuay, shakoy* or *pathongko*, among other names. ## Culinary applications and variants At breakfast, *youtiao* can be stuffed inside *[shāobǐng](/wiki/Sh%C4%81ob%C7%90ng)* (traditional Chinese: 燒餅; simplified Chinese: 烧饼; lit. 'roasted flatbread') to make a [sandwich](/wiki/Sandwich) known as ***shāobǐng yóutiáo*** (traditional Chinese: 燒餅油條; simplified Chinese: 烧饼油条). Youtiao wrapped in a [rice noodle roll](/wiki/Rice_noodle_roll) is known as *[zháliǎng](/wiki/Zh%C3%A1li%C7%8Eng)*. In [Yunnan](/wiki/Yunnan), a roasted rice flour pancake usually wrapped around a *youtiao* is known as *[erkuai](/wiki/Erkuai)* (traditional Chinese: 燒餌塊; simplified Chinese: 烧饵块). Yet another name for a sandwich variant is [*jianbingguǒzi*](/wiki/Jianbing_guozi) (traditional Chinese: 煎餅果子; simplified Chinese: 煎饼果子; lit. 'youtiao and fried bread'). *Youtiao* is occasionally dipped into various liquids, for example the soup *[xidoufen](/wiki/Xidoufen)*, soy milk (sweet or salty), and soy sauce. Youtiao is also an important ingredient of the food *[cífàn tuán](/wiki/C%C3%ADf%C3%A0n_tu%C3%A1n)* in [Shanghai cuisine](/wiki/Shanghai_cuisine). *Tánggāo* (Chinese: 糖糕), or \"sugar cake\", is a sweet, fried food item similar in appearance to youtiao but shorter in length. In Thailand, *youtiao* or *pathongko* (ปาท่องโก๋) in Thai are eaten for breakfast with [soy milk](/wiki/Soy_milk) or [porridge](/wiki/Porridge). Similarly, in Indonesia *youtiao* or *cakwe* in Indonesian can be eaten for breakfast with porridge by chopping it into thin slices. Cakwe stands can also be found in the evening, usually eaten with a special liquid red sauce. ## Names ### Cambodia In [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia), it is called *cha kway* ([Khmer](/wiki/Khmer_language): ឆាខ្វៃ) and usually dipped in *[kuy teav](/wiki/Kuy_teav)*, [congee](/wiki/Congee#Cambodia) or coffee. Some [Chinese Cambodian](/wiki/Chinese_Cambodians) immigrants in [Australia](/wiki/Australia) sometimes call it **chopstick cake** because of its resemblance to a pair of [chopsticks](/wiki/Chopsticks). ### China Although generally known as *yóutiáo* in Standard Mandarin, the dish is also known as *guǒzi* (餜子) in [northern China](/wiki/Northern_and_southern_China). In [Min Nan](/wiki/Min_Nan)-speaking areas, such as [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan), it is known as *iû-chiā-kóe* (油炸粿), where *kóe* (粿/餜) means cake or pastry, hence \"oil-fried cake/pastry\". In [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese)-speaking areas this is rendered as *yàuh ja gwái* (油炸鬼), where literally means \"Oil-fried devil\".[a] #### Folk etymology The [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese) name 油炸鬼 ([Cantonese Yale](/wiki/Yale_romanization_of_Cantonese): *yàuh ja gwái*) is, according to folklore, an act of protest against [Song dynasty](/wiki/Song_dynasty) official [Qin Hui](/wiki/Qin_Hui_(Song_dynasty)), who is said to have orchestrated the plot to frame the general [Yue Fei](/wiki/Yue_Fei), an icon of [patriotism](/wiki/Patriotism) in [Chinese culture](/wiki/Culture_of_China). It is said that the food, originally in the shape of two human-shaped pieces of dough but later evolved into two pieces joined in the middle, represents Qin Hui and his wife, both having a hand in collaborating with the enemy to bring about the great general's demise. Thus the youtiao is deep fried and eaten as if done to the traitorous couple. In Mandarin, the name 油炸燴 ([pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *yóuzháhuì*) from folklore literally means \"oil-fried Hui\" in protest of his actions. The Cantonese pronunciation *yàuh ja gwái* rhymes with this Mandarin pronunciation. In keeping with the legend, youtiao are often made as two foot-long rolls of dough joined along the middle, with one roll representing the husband and the other the wife. The Cantonese name may derive from [Guangzhou](/wiki/Guangzhou) being the last resistance front before the Song dynasty collapsed. ### Indonesia In Indonesia, the fried dough is known as *cakwe* (pronounced [tʃakwe]). It is commonly chopped or thinly sliced and then eaten for breakfast with *[bubur ayam](/wiki/Bubur_ayam)* (chicken congee) or eaten as snacks with dipping of local version of chilli vinaigrette or peanut / satay sauce. In [Java](/wiki/Java), cakwe is usually sold as a street snack at [kaki lima](/wiki/Street_food_of_Indonesia), usually at the same stalls that sell *bolang-baling* or *roti goreng* (sweet fried dough) and *[untir-untir](/wiki/Untir-untir)* ([Javanese](/wiki/Javanese_language) version of *[mahua](/wiki/Mahua_(snack))*). This snack is sometime served with spicy sweet salty sauce (optional). Savory cakwe, sweet bolang-baling and crunchy untir-untir are to be considered to compliment each other in a snack mix. ### Laos In [Laos](/wiki/Laos), youtiao is generally called *kao nom kou* or *patongko* (*cf.* Thai *patongko*) or \"chao quay\", and is commonly eaten with coffee at breakfast in place of a [baguette](/wiki/Baguette) (*khao jee falang*). It is also eaten as an accompaniment to \"khao piek sen\" (chicken noodle soup) or \"jok\" (congee).[*citation needed*] ### Malaysia It is rendered in [Malay language](/wiki/Malay_language) as *cakoi*, an alteration of the Minnan term, *char kway*. The name *pathongko* (see Thailand) is more common in the northern states of [Kedah](/wiki/Kedah), [Perlis](/wiki/Perlis) and [Penang](/wiki/Penang), *kayu khamak* or *kuduh* in [Terengganu](/wiki/Terengganu), *kocok* in [Pahang](/wiki/Pahang) and [Perak](/wiki/Perak) and *cakuwe* in [Kelantan](/wiki/Kelantan). *Cakoi* is usually sold in morning street markets or [night markets](/wiki/Pasar_malam) and commonly eaten with coffee or soy milk for breakfast or at tea time. ### Myanmar The youtiao is also a popular breakfast food in [Myanmar](/wiki/Myanmar) (Burma) where it is called *e kya kway* (အီကြာကွေး [ì tʒà ku̯éː]). It is usually eaten with steamed yellow beans (with salt and oil) or dipped into coffee or tea, or with [condensed milk](/wiki/Condensed_milk)(နို့ဆီ). E kya kway is also eaten with rice porridge, or cut into small rings and used as a condiment for [mohinga](/wiki/Mohinga). Tea culture is prevalent in Myanmar, and almost every shop will serve e kya kway for breakfast.[*citation needed*] Some shops stuff meat into the youtiao and deep fry it over again. It is called *e kya kway asar thoot* – stuffed e kya kway. ### Philippines In the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines), it is either known as *Bicho* / *Bicho-Bicho* ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien): 米棗 [Pe̍h-ōe-jī](/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB): bí-tsó) or *[Shakoy](/wiki/Shakoy)* / *Siyakoy* ([Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien): 炸粿 [Pe̍h-ōe-jī](/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB): tsia̍h-kué) / *Pinisi* / *lubid-lubid.* They are usually deep-fried, in the case of Bicho-Bicho, or deep-fried and twisted, in the case of Shakoy. Dry, smaller and crunchy versions are called *[pilipit](/wiki/Pilipit)*. ### Singapore In [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), it is known as *yu char kway*, which is the transliteration of its [Hokkien](/wiki/Southern_Min) (Minnan) name (油炸粿 *iû-tsiā-kué*). Apart from the plain version, the Singaporean take on Youtiao also comes with various fillings which are either sweet, such as red bean paste or savory ([ham chim peng](/wiki/Ham_chim_peng), 鹹煎餅), such as sardines in tomato sauce. The plain version is often eaten with sweet chili sauce or coconut and egg jam called *[kaya](/wiki/Kaya_(jam))*, or served with [bak kut teh](/wiki/Bak_kut_teh) (肉骨茶), porridge or rice [congee](/wiki/Congee), sliced thinly to be dipped into the broth or congee and eaten. ### Taiwan In [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan), Youtiao is often known by its [Hokkien](/wiki/Southern_Min) name (油炸粿 *iû-tsiā-kué*) and is a popular breakfast item throughout Taiwan. Youtiao are usually sandwiched into [shaobings](/wiki/Shaobing) or cut into sections and wrapped in [rice balls](/wiki/Rice_ball), or eaten with [almond milk](/wiki/Almond_milk), [soy milk](/wiki/Soy_milk), and [douhua](/wiki/Douhua) for breakfast. It is also an essential ingredient for [Tainan](/wiki/Tainan)-style [congee](/wiki/Congee) and salty soy milk, and it is also an indispensable ingredient for Tainan beef soup and as a side for Taiwanese-style spicy [hot pot](/wiki/Hot_pot). ### Thailand In [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand), youtiao is generally called *pathongko* ([Thai](/wiki/Thai_language): ปาท่องโก๋, pronounced [paːtʰɔ̂ŋkǒː]) due to a confusion with a different kind of dessert. *Pathongko* is a loanword adapted from either [Teochew](/wiki/Teochew_dialect) [Minnan](/wiki/Southern_Min) *beh teung guai* (白糖粿; Mandarin: *bái tángguǒ*) or [Cantonese](/wiki/Standard_Cantonese) of *baahktònggòu* (白糖糕; Mandarin: bái tánggāo). However, both possible original names referred to a different dessert, the [white sugar sponge cake](/wiki/White_sugar_sponge_cake). It was previously sold together with youtiao by [street vendors](/wiki/Hawker_(trade)) who normally walked around and shouted both names out loud. However, Thai customers often mistakenly thought that the more popular youtiao was \"*pathongko*\". Eventually, the real *pathongko* disappeared from the market because of its unpopularity. The disappearance of real \"*pathongko*\" left the youtiao labeled under the former's name, while the latter's real name is generally unknown amongst the Thais. The original white sugar sponge cake can still be easily found in [Trang Province](/wiki/Trang_Province) in [Southern Thailand](/wiki/Southern_Thailand) under its original name while youtiao is still called \"*chakoi*\" or \"*chiakoi*\" by some Southerners. In Thailand, *pathongko* is often dipped in condensed milk or, in the southern regions, served with [kaya](/wiki/Coconut_jam). In certain provinces, such as [Chanthaburi](/wiki/Chanthaburi_Province) and [Kanchanaburi](/wiki/Kanchanaburi_Province), it is enjoyed with a sweet-and-sour dipping sauce, which is considered a local delicacy. ### Vietnam In [Vietnamese cuisine](/wiki/Vietnamese_cuisine), it is known by a name that is a pronunciation similar to the Cantonese pronunciation, as *dầu cháo quẩy*, *giò cháo quẩy* or simply *quẩy*. 油 (\"dầu/giò\"), 鬼 (\"quỷ/quẩy\") coming from the approximate Cantonese pronunciation. In Vietnam, *giò cháo quẩy* is eaten typically with congee or *[phở](/wiki/Ph%E1%BB%9F)* in Hanoi, and sometimes with [wonton noodle](/wiki/Wonton_noodle) (*mì hoành thánh* or *mì vằn thắn*). In Southern Vietnam, quẩy is often enjoyed with *[bánh canh cua](/wiki/B%C3%A1nh_canh)*, or dipped in hot soymilk as a quick breakfast. - Food portal - Asia portal - China portal - [Fried dough foods](/wiki/Fried_dough_foods) - [List of Chinese dishes](/wiki/List_of_Chinese_dishes) - [List of doughnut varieties](/wiki/List_of_doughnut_varieties) - [List of deep fried foods](/wiki/List_of_deep_fried_foods) - [List of snack foods](/wiki/List_of_snack_foods) - [List of street foods](/wiki/List_of_street_foods) - [Zhaliang](/wiki/Zhaliang) - [Ci fan tuan](/wiki/Ci_fan_tuan) ### Other Chinese fried dough dishes - [Ham chim peng](/wiki/Ham_chim_peng) - [Ox-tongue pastry](/wiki/Ox-tongue_pastry) - [Shuangbaotai](/wiki/Shuangbaotai) ## Explanatory notes\n",
