Masjid Bencoolen can accommodate 1,100 worshipers. The mosque is co-located and integrated with a 12-storey Somerset Bencoolen serviced apartment tower. ## History Founded in 1825, the building was originally an [attap mosque](/wiki/Attap_dwelling) built by Bencoolen Muslims. The building was later replaced in 1845 by a permanent version built by an Arab merchant, Syed Omar bin Aljunied. In 2001, due to redevelopment of the area, it was demolished for Somerset Bencoolen, a mixed used residential complex. The mosque itself is integrated into the building and opened in 2004. In 2019, it was announced that it would undergo a 15-month long upgrading programme estimated to cost S$4 million, which increased the capacity from around 450 to 1,450 congregants. ## Transportation The mosque is accessible from [Bencoolen MRT station](/wiki/Bencoolen_MRT_station). - [Islam in Singapore](/wiki/Islam_in_Singapore) - [List of mosques in Singapore](/wiki/List_of_mosques_in_Singapore) - This article about a [mosque](/wiki/Mosque) or other [Islamic](/wiki/Islamic) place of worship in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) is a stub.
