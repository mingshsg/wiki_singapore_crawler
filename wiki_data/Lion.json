  "content": "Large cat native to Africa and India The **lion** (***Panthera leo***) is a large [cat](/wiki/Felidae) of the genus *[Panthera](/wiki/Panthera)*, currently ranging only in [Sub-Saharan Africa](/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa) and [India](/wiki/India). It has a muscular, broad-chested [body](/wiki/Body_(biology)); a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is [sexually dimorphic](/wiki/Sexually_dimorphic); adult male lions are larger than females and have a more prominent mane that usually obscures the ears and extends to the shoulders. The lion inhabits [grasslands](/wiki/Grassland), [savannahs](/wiki/Savannah), and [shrublands](/wiki/Shrubland). It is an [apex](/wiki/Apex_predator) and [keystone predator](/wiki/Keystone_predator), preying mostly on medium-sized and large [ungulates](/wiki/Ungulate). It is usually more [diurnal](/wiki/Diurnality) than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active [at night](/wiki/Nocturnality) and [at twilight](/wiki/Crepuscular). It is a [social species](/wiki/Social_species), forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of related females and cubs, and a few or one adult male who is unrelated to the females. Groups of female lions usually hunt together. Adult males often compete to keep or gain that membership in the pride. During the [Neolithic](/wiki/Neolithic) period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in [western India](/wiki/Western_India). It has been listed as [Vulnerable](/wiki/Vulnerable_species) on the [IUCN Red List](/wiki/IUCN_Red_List) since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, [habitat loss](/wiki/Habitat_loss) and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern. The lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in literature and films. It is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. Lions have been kept in [menageries](/wiki/Menagerie) since the time of the [Roman Empire](/wiki/Roman_Empire) and have been a key species sought for exhibition in [zoological gardens](/wiki/Zoological_garden) across the world since the late 18th century. [Cultural depictions of lions](/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_lions) have occurred worldwide, particularly as a symbol of power and royalty. They figure prominently as symbols and deities in ancient religions. ## Etymology The English word *lion* is derived via [Anglo-Norman](/wiki/Anglo-Norman_language) *liun* from [Latin](/wiki/Latin) *leōnem* (nominative: *leō*), which in turn was a borrowing from [Ancient Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greek) λέων *léōn*. The [Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language) word לָבִיא *lavi* may also be related. The generic name *Panthera* is traceable to the [classical Latin](/wiki/Classical_Latin) word 'panthēra' and the [ancient Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greek) word πάνθηρ 'panther'. ## Taxonomy *[Panthera](/wiki/Panthera)* [Snow leopard](/wiki/Snow_leopard) [Tiger](/wiki/Tiger) [Jaguar](/wiki/Jaguar) [Leopard](/wiki/Leopard) **Lion** Phylogeny of the genus *Panthera* based on a 2016 [nuclear DNA](/wiki/Nuclear_DNA) study *Felis leo* was the [scientific name](/wiki/Scientific_name) used by [Carl Linnaeus](/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus) in 1758, who described the lion in his work *[Systema Naturae](/wiki/Systema_Naturae)*. The genus name *Panthera* was coined by [Lorenz Oken](/wiki/Lorenz_Oken) in 1816. Between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries, 26 lion [specimens](/wiki/Zoological_specimen) were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as [valid](/wiki/Valid_name_(zoology)) in 2005. They were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and skins. ### Subspecies In the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion [type specimens](/wiki/Type_specimen) were described and proposed as [subspecies](/wiki/Subspecies), with about a dozen recognised as [valid](/wiki/Valid_name_(zoology)) [taxa](/wiki/Taxon) until 2017. Between 2008 and 2016, [IUCN Red List](/wiki/IUCN_Red_List) assessors used only two subspecific names: *P. l. leo* for African lion populations, and *P. l. persica* for the Asiatic lion population. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised lion [taxonomy](/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)), and recognises two subspecies based on results of several [phylogeographic](/wiki/Phylogeographic) studies on lion [evolution](/wiki/Evolution), namely: - [*P. l. leo*](/wiki/Panthera_leo_leo) (Linnaeus, 1758) − the [nominate](/wiki/Nominate_subspecies) lion subspecies includes the [Asiatic lion](/wiki/Asiatic_lion), the [regionally extinct](/wiki/Locally_extinct) [Barbary lion](/wiki/Barbary_lion), and lion populations in West and northern parts of Central Africa. [Synonyms](/wiki/Synonym_(taxonomy)) include *P. l. persica* (Meyer, 1826), *P. l. senegalensis* (Meyer, 1826), *P. l. kamptzi* ([Matschie](/wiki/Paul_Matschie), 1900), and *P. l. azandica* ([Allen](/wiki/Joel_Asaph_Allen), 1924). It has been called 'northern lion' and 'northern subspecies'. - [*P. l. melanochaita*](/wiki/Panthera_leo_melanochaita) ([Smith](/wiki/Charles_Hamilton_Smith), 1842) − includes the extinct [Cape lion](/wiki/Cape_lion) and lion populations in East and Southern African regions. Synonyms include *P. l. somaliensis* (Noack 1891), *P. l. massaica* ([Neumann](/wiki/Oscar_Neumann), 1900), *P. l. sabakiensis* ([Lönnberg](/wiki/Einar_L%C3%B6nnberg), 1910), *P. l. bleyenberghi* (Lönnberg, 1914), *P. l. roosevelti* ([Heller](/wiki/Edmund_Heller), 1914), *P. l. nyanzae* (Heller, 1914), *P. l. hollisteri* ([Allen](/wiki/Joel_Asaph_Allen), 1924), *P. l. krugeri* ([Roberts](/wiki/Austin_Roberts_(zoologist)), 1929), *P. l. vernayi* (Roberts, 1948), and *P. l. webbiensis* (Zukowsky, 1964). It has been referred to as 'southern subspecies' and 'southern lion'. However, there seems to be some degree of overlap between both groups in northern Central Africa. DNA analysis from a more recent study indicates that Central African lions are derived from both northern and southern lions, as they cluster with *P. leo leo* in mtDNA-based phylogenies whereas their genomic DNA indicates a closer relationship with P. *leo melanochaita*. Lion samples from some parts of the [Ethiopian Highlands](/wiki/Ethiopian_Highlands) cluster genetically with those from Cameroon and Chad, while lions from other areas of Ethiopia cluster with samples from East Africa. Researchers, therefore, assume Ethiopia is a contact zone between the two subspecies. [Genome](/wiki/Genome)-wide data of a wild-born historical lion sample from Sudan showed that it clustered with *P. l. leo* in mtDNA-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to *P. l. melanochaita*; this suggested that the taxonomic position of lions in Central Africa may require revision. ### Fossil records Other lion subspecies or [sister species](/wiki/Sister_species) to the modern lion existed in prehistoric times: - [*P. fossilis*](/wiki/Panthera_fossilis) was larger than the modern lion and lived in the [Middle Pleistocene](/wiki/Middle_Pleistocene). Bone fragments were excavated in caves in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Czech Republic. - *[P. spelaea](/wiki/Panthera_spelaea)*, or the cave lion, lived in [Eurasia](/wiki/Eurasia) and [Beringia](/wiki/Beringia) during the [Late Pleistocene](/wiki/Late_Pleistocene). It became extinct due to [climate warming](/wiki/Climate_warming) or [human expansion](/wiki/Early_human_migrations) latest by 11,900 years ago. Bone fragments excavated in European, North Asian, Canadian and Alaskan caves indicate that it ranged from Europe across Siberia into western Alaska. It likely derived from *P. fossilis*, and was genetically isolated and highly distinct from the modern lion in Africa and Eurasia. It is depicted in [Paleolithic](/wiki/Paleolithic) cave paintings, ivory carvings, and clay busts. - [*P. atrox*](/wiki/American_lion), or the American lion, ranged in the Americas from Canada to possibly [Patagonia](/wiki/Patagonia) during the Late Pleistocene. It diverged from the cave lion around 165,000 years ago. Additionally, in 1938 paleontologist [Paulus Deraniyagala](/wiki/Paulus_Edward_Pieris_Deraniyagala) named a subspecies *P. l. sinhaleyus* based on two fossils, a lower left carnassial and a damaged right lower canine tooth, both excavated from deposits in [Kuruwita](/wiki/Kuruwita), Sri Lanka. He called it \"narrower and more elongate\" but otherwise failed to distinguish *P. l. sinhaleyus* from other lion subspecies. A subsequent study of felid fossils from the Kuruwita deposits in 2005 described the fossils in further detail but only assigned to them to *P. leo*. ### Evolution The *Panthera* [lineage](/wiki/Lineage_(evolution)) is estimated to have [genetically diverged](/wiki/Genetic_divergence) from the [common ancestor](/wiki/Common_ancestor) of the [Felidae](/wiki/Felidae) around 10.8 million years ago. [Hybridisation](/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)) between lion and [snow leopard](/wiki/Snow_leopard) ancestors possibly continued until about 2.1 million years ago. The lion-leopard clade was distributed in the Asian and African [Palearctic](/wiki/Palearctic) since at least the early [Pliocene](/wiki/Pliocene). The earliest fossils recognisable as lions were found at [Olduvai Gorge](/wiki/Olduvai_Gorge) in Tanzania and are estimated to be up to 2 million years old. Estimates for the divergence time of the modern and cave lion lineages range from 529,000 to 392,000 years ago based on [mutation rate](/wiki/Mutation_rate) per generation time of the modern lion. There is no evidence for [gene flow](/wiki/Gene_flow) between the two lineages, indicating that they did not share the same geographic area. The Eurasian and American cave lions became extinct at the end of the [last glacial period](/wiki/Last_glacial_period) without [mitochondrial](/wiki/Mitochondrion) descendants on other continents. The modern lion was probably widely distributed in Africa during the [Middle Pleistocene](/wiki/Middle_Pleistocene) and started to diverge in sub-Saharan Africa during the Late Pleistocene. Lion populations in East and Southern Africa became separated from populations in West and North Africa when the equatorial rainforest expanded 183,500 to 81,800 years ago. They shared a common ancestor probably between 98,000 and 52,000 years ago. Due to the expansion of the Sahara between 83,100 and 26,600 years ago, lion populations in West and North Africa became separated. As the rainforest decreased and thus gave rise to more open habitats, lions moved from West to Central Africa. Lions from North Africa dispersed to southern Europe and Asia between 38,800 and 8,300 years ago. Extinction of lions in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East interrupted gene flow between lion populations in Asia and Africa. Genetic evidence revealed numerous [mutations](/wiki/Mutation) in lion samples from East and Southern Africa, which indicates that this group has a longer evolutionary history than genetically less diverse lion samples from Asia and West and Central Africa. A whole genome-wide sequence of lion samples showed that samples from West Africa shared [alleles](/wiki/Alleles) with samples from Southern Africa, and samples from Central Africa shared alleles with samples from Asia. This phenomenon indicates that Central Africa was a melting pot of lion populations after they had become isolated, possibly migrating through corridors in the [Nile Basin](/wiki/Nile_Basin) during the early [Holocene](/wiki/Holocene). ### Hybrids In zoos, lions have been bred with [tigers](/wiki/Tiger) to create hybrids for the curiosity of visitors or for scientific purpose. The [liger](/wiki/Liger) is bigger than a lion and a tiger, whereas most [tigons](/wiki/Tigon) are relatively small compared to their parents because of reciprocal gene effects. The [leopon](/wiki/Leopon) is a hybrid between a lion and leopard. ## Description The lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears; males have broader heads. The fur varies in colour from light [buff](/wiki/Buff_(colour)) to silvery grey, yellowish red, and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark [spots](/wiki/Rosette_(zoology)), which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots may still be seen on the legs and underparts. The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that, in some lions, conceals an approximately 5 mm (0.20 in)-long, hard \"spine\" or \"spur\" composed of dermal papillae. The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth, develops at around 5+1⁄2 months of age and is readily identifiable at the age of seven months. Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened and has a slightly shorter [postorbital](/wiki/Postorbital) region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species. The skeletal muscles of the lion make up 58.8% of its body weight and represent the highest percentage of muscles among mammals. The lion has a high concentration of [fast twitch muscle](/wiki/Fast_twitch_muscle) fibres, giving them quick bursts of speed but less stamina. ### Size Among felids, the lion is second only to the tiger in size. The size and weight of adult lions vary across its range and habitats. Accounts of a few individuals that were larger than average exist from Africa and India. AverageFemale lionsMale lionsHead-and-body length160–184 cm (63–72 in)184–208 cm (72–82 in)Tail length72–89.5 cm (28.3–35.2 in)82.5–93.5 cm (32.5–36.8 in)Weight118.37–143.52 kg (261.0–316.4 lb) in Southern Africa, 119.5 kg (263 lb) in East Africa, 110–120 kg (240–260 lb) in India186.55–225 kg (411.3–496.0 lb) in Southern Africa, 174.9 kg (386 lb) in East Africa, 160–190 kg (350–420 lb) in India ### Mane The male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species. It may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago. It grows downwards and backwards, covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust, and black hairs. Mutations in the genes [microphthalmia-associated transcription factor](/wiki/Microphthalmia-associated_transcription_factor) and [tyrosinase](/wiki/Tyrosinase) are possibly responsible for the colour of manes. It starts growing when lions enter adolescence, when [testosterone](/wiki/Testosterone) levels increase, and reach their full size at around four years old. Cool ambient temperatures in European and North American zoos may result in a heavier mane. On average, Asiatic lions have sparser manes than African lions.[*page needed*] This feature likely evolved to signal the [fitness](/wiki/Fitness_(biology)) of males to females. Males with darker manes appear to have greater reproductive success and are more likely to remain in a pride for longer. They have longer and thicker hair and higher testosterone levels, but they are also more vulnerable to heat stress. The core body temperature does apparently not increase regardless of sex, season, feeding time, length and colour of mane, but only surface temperature is affected. Unlike in other felid species, female lions consistently interact with multiple males at once. Another hypothesis suggests that the mane also serves to protect the neck in fights, but this is disputed. During fights, including those involving maneless females and adolescents, the neck is not targeted as much as the face, back, and hindquarters. Injured lions also begin to lose their manes. Almost all male lions in [Pendjari National Park](/wiki/Pendjari_National_Park) are either maneless or have very short manes. [Maneless lions](/wiki/Maneless_lion) have also been reported in Senegal, in [Sudan](/wiki/Sudan)'s [Dinder National Park](/wiki/Dinder_National_Park) and in [Tsavo East National Park](/wiki/Tsavo_East_National_Park), Kenya. [Castrated](/wiki/Castration) lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the [gonads](/wiki/Gonad) inhibits testosterone production. Lionesses rarely have manes. Increased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern Botswana. ### Colour variation\n",
