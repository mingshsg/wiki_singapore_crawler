Although the position has *[de facto](/wiki/De_facto)* existed since 1955, it was formally established in 2020, with [Pritam Singh](/wiki/Pritam_Singh_(Singaporean_politician)) of the [Workers' Party](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Singapore)) (WP) serving since 24 August 2020. ## History The Leader of the Opposition was previously an unofficial *[de facto](/wiki/De_facto)* position in the Parliament of Singapore, as the Constitution and standing orders of Parliament did not make provision for such an office. Those who performed the role did so without any formal recognition or additional parliamentary privileges. As a result, the Leader of the Opposition did not receive any remuneration beyond the ordinary allowance provided to other regular [Members of Parliament](/wiki/Members_of_Parliament). The formal office of the Leader of the Opposition was established following the [2020 general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election), in which the [Workers' Party](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Singapore)) won ten seats in Parliament. Prime Minister [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) announced that a formal office would be created, and that the Leader of the Opposition would be provided with the necessary manpower support and resources to carry out the role effectively. [Pritam Singh](/wiki/Pritam_Singh), as the Secretary-General of the Workers' Party, was formally designated as the Leader of the Opposition in 2020. The Leader of the Opposition draws an annual salary of [S$](/wiki/SGD)385,000, double the salary of a regular MP. As is the case in other [Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) countries operating under a [Westminster parliamentary system](/wiki/Westminster_system) of government, the appointment in Singapore is supported by a [secretariat](/wiki/Secretariat_(administrative_office)) and includes access to office facilities within the Parliament buildings. The role carries with it clearly defined duties and institutional support, marking a shift from its previous informal status to a formal and recognised component of Singapore's parliamentary structure. ## Overview ### Duties The Leader of the Opposition is expected to lead the opposition in presenting alternative views during parliamentary debates on policies, bills and motions. The role includes overseeing and coordinating the scrutiny of the Government’s positions and actions in Parliament, as well as being consulted on the appointment of opposition members to various Select Committees, including Standing Select Committees such as the Public Accounts Committee. In addition to parliamentary responsibilities, the Leader of the Opposition may be called upon to carry out other official duties. These can include attending state functions, as well as participating in visits and meetings alongside members of the Government and the Public Service. The appointment is accompanied by additional parliamentary privileges and responsibilities, recognising the importance of the role within Singapore’s parliamentary system. The Leader of the Opposition serves as the principal spokesperson for the opposition and plays a central part in ensuring that Government actions are subject to robust and organised oversight. ### Powers and resources In Parliament, the Leader of the Opposition is generally accorded the right of first response among Members of Parliament and is permitted to pose the lead question to ministers during debates on policies, bills and motions, in accordance with established speaking conventions. The Leader is also granted a longer speaking time for speeches, equal to that of political officeholders. Beyond access to government data available to all MPs, the Leader of the Opposition is provided with confidential briefings by the Government on specific matters concerning national security and external relations. These briefings may also be extended in times of national crisis or emergency. The Leader of the Opposition is allocated an office and a meeting room within [Parliament House](/wiki/Parliament_House,_Singapore). They are entitled to additional staffing support, with allowances provided for up to three legislative assistants, on top of the standard provision for one legislative assistant and one secretarial assistant granted to all MPs. A dedicated secretary is also assigned to assist with administrative and parliamentary matters. ## List of officeholders Political parties [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) [Barisan Sosialis](/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis) (BS) [Singapore People's Alliance](/wiki/Singapore_People%27s_Alliance) (SPA) [Workers' Party](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Singapore)) (WP) [Singapore Democratic Party](/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Party) (SDP) [Singapore People's Party](/wiki/Singapore_People%27s_Party) (SPP) ### *De facto* No.PortraitName Constituency (Birth–Death)Took officeLeft officeTime in officeElectionParty**1****[Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew)** MP for [Tanjong Pagar](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar_Single_Member_Constituency) (1923–2015)22 April 195531 March 19593 years, 343 days(/wiki/1955_Singaporean_general_election)[PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)**2****[Lim Yew Hock](/wiki/Lim_Yew_Hock)** MP for [Cairnhill](/wiki/Cairnhill_Single_Member_Constituency) (1914–1984)1 July 19593 September 19634 years, 64 days(/wiki/1959_Singaporean_general_election)[SPA](/wiki/Singapore_People%27s_Alliance)**3****Lim Huan Boon** MP for [Bukit Merah](/wiki/Bukit_Merah_Single_Member_Constituency) (born 1929)22 October 196331 December 19652 years, 70 days(/wiki/1963_Singaporean_general_election)[BS](/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis)**4****[Chia Thye Poh](/wiki/Chia_Thye_Poh)** MP for [Jurong](/wiki/Jurong_Single_Member_Constituency) (born 1941)1 January 19667 October 1966279 days–[BS](/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis)*None*[b] (7 October 1966–22 December 1981)**5****[J.
