It is a hilly neighbourhood in the west-central area of the Southeast Asian [city-state](/wiki/City-state) of Singapore. In the [Malay language](/wiki/Malay_language), *bukit* means hill and *gombak* a bunch or collection of something. The neighbourhood consists of two hills. One of them stands at 133m while the other stands at 113m. They are Singapore's second and third highest natural point after [Bukit Timah Hill](/wiki/Bukit_Timah_Hill). Bukit Gombak is bounded by Bukit Batok Road, West Avenue 5, the North side of Bukit Gombak Sports Complex, West and North side of Town Park, the North-West and North side of the landed housing estate along Hillview Avenue, Upper Bukit Timah Road and Choa Chu Kang Road. It is generally regarded as the area around the elevated [Mass Rapid Transit](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) (MRT) [train station](/wiki/Bukit_Gombak_MRT_station) of the same name (NS3), including the hills to the east of the station and HDB apartment blocks along Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 and East Avenue 5.
