  "content": "Southeast Asian pickled vegetables **Acar** (Indonesian pronunciation: [ˈat͡ʃar]) is a type of vegetable [pickle](/wiki/Pickling) of [Maritime Southeast Asia](/wiki/Maritime_Southeast_Asia), most prevalent in [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) and [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei). It is a localised version of Indian *[achar](/wiki/South_Asian_pickle)*. It is known as **atjar** in [Dutch cuisine](/wiki/Dutch_cuisine), derived from Indonesian *acar*. *Acar* is usually prepared in bulk as it may easily be stored in a well-sealed glass jar in refrigerator for a week, and served as a condiment for any meals. ## History Pickling [originated in India](/wiki/Pickling#History) around 2400 BCE, and with expansion of [Indian cultural influence](/wiki/Indosphere) on [Greater India](/wiki/Greater_India), through transmission of [Hinduism](/wiki/Hinduism_in_Southeast_Asia) leading to [Indianisation](/wiki/Indianization_of_Southeast_Asia), and the formation of native Southeast Asian [kingdoms](/wiki/Indianized_kingdom) which adopted many Indian cultural elements, including food processing techniques. Through examining the etymology, the similar sounding name strongly suggests that indeed acar was derived from the Indian [achar](/wiki/South_Asian_pickle) pickle. Indian achar was transmitted in antiquity to the maritime realm of Southeast Asia, which today is recognized as acar in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, and then on to the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines) as *[atchara](/wiki/Atchara)*. The adoption of this vegetable pickling technique possibly took place during the [Srivijaya](/wiki/Srivijaya) period between 7th to 13th century. British navigator [Thomas Forrest](/wiki/Thomas_Forrest_(navigator)) wrote that acar made of salted limes and palm vinegar were often of use to [Coromandel](/wiki/Coromandel_Coast) [Muslim](/wiki/Tamil_Muslims) sailors (*Chulias*) to prevent [scurvy](/wiki/Scurvy) and were sold as far as [Aceh](/wiki/Aceh). ## Ingredients The Southeast Asian variations are usually made from different vegetables such as [cucumber](/wiki/Cucumber), [carrots](/wiki/Carrot), [cabbage](/wiki/Cabbage), [shallot](/wiki/Shallot), [bird's eye chili](/wiki/Bird%27s_eye_chili) and [yardlong beans](/wiki/Yardlong_bean), which are pickled in [vinegar](/wiki/Vinegar), sometimes with [kaffir lime](/wiki/Kaffir_lime) to add citrus aroma, and also dried [chillies](/wiki/Chile_pepper). Some recipes might have the vegetables tossed in ground [peanuts](/wiki/Peanut). *Acar* is commonly served as a condiment to be eaten with a main course, such as *[martabak](/wiki/Murtabak)*, *[nasi goreng](/wiki/Nasi_goreng)* (fried rice), [satay](/wiki/Satay), and almost all varieties of *[soto](/wiki/Soto_(food))*. Just like common [pickles](/wiki/List_of_pickled_foods), the sour taste of *acar* is meant to freshen up a meal, especially fishy dishes such as *[ikan bakar](/wiki/Ikan_bakar)* (grilled fish) or rich and oily dishes such as [mutton satay](/wiki/Satay#Sate_kambing) to neutralize the fat. ## Regional cuisines In [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine), acar is commonly made from small chunks of cucumber, carrot, shallot, bird's eye chili and occasionally pineapple, and marinated in a sweet and sour solution of sugar and vinegar. Some households add lemongrass or ginger to spice it up. It is usually used as condiment to accompany grilled foods such as [satay](/wiki/Satay). Nevertheless, *acar* can also be consumed as a whole, complete dish. For example, *ikan acar kuning* is a fish dish ([gourami](/wiki/Gourami), [mackerel](/wiki/Mackerel_as_food) or [tilapia](/wiki/Tilapia)) served in *acar* pickles of cucumber, carrot, shallot and red chili, mixed with yellow spice paste made of ground turmeric, candlenut, ginger, garlic and shallot. It is known as *atjar* (pickle) in [Dutch cuisine](/wiki/Dutch_cuisine), derived from Indonesian *acar*, since the Netherlands and Indonesia share colonial ties. Variations of Malaysian and Singaporean *acar* include *acar awak* or [Nyonya](/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine) *acar* and [Malay](/wiki/Malay_people) *acar*. *Acar awak* is more elaborate, containing additional vegetables such as [eggplants](/wiki/Eggplant) as well as aromatic spices in the pickling mix. The salad has also been adopted into [Thai cuisine](/wiki/Thai_cuisine), where it is called *[achat](/wiki/Thai_salads#Other_Thai_salads)* ([Thai](/wiki/Thai_language): อาจาด, pronounced [ʔāː.t͡ɕàːt]). It is made with cucumber, red chilies, red onions or shallots, vinegar, sugar and salt. It is served as a side dish with the Thai version of [satay](/wiki/Satay) ([Thai](/wiki/Thai_language): สะเต๊ะ). With Indian and Malay slaves initially brought by the British Empire, *atchar* became a favourite condiment in South Africa. The local variation is usually made with green mangoes. - Food portal - Indonesia portal - Malaysia portal - Netherlands portal - Singapore portal - [Atchara](/wiki/Atchara) – Filpino unripe papaya pickle ([Philippine cuisine](/wiki/Philippine_cuisine)) - [Achar](/wiki/South_Asian_pickle) – Pickled varieties of vegetable and fruit - [Thai salads](/wiki/Thai_salads) – Thai cuisine - [List of salads](/wiki/List_of_salads)\n",
