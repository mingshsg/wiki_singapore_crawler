Different varieties of the dish exist in [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_cuisine), [Taiwanese](/wiki/Taiwanese_cuisine), [Malaysian](/wiki/Malaysian_cuisine), [Singaporean](/wiki/Singaporean_cuisine) cuisine. ## Varieties There are many different ways of cooking drunken chicken. One with [Shaoxing](/wiki/Shaoxing) wine originated in the [Zhejiang](/wiki/Zhejiang) province of eastern [China](/wiki/China). Shaoxing drunk chicken is cooked and [marinated](/wiki/Marinated) in [Shaoxing wine](/wiki/Shaoxing_wine) to create a deep taste. In another version of the dish, the whole chicken is first [steamed](/wiki/Steaming) then chopped up into pieces appropriately sized for picking up by [chopsticks](/wiki/Chopstick). The steamed meat, along with its juice, is cooked with [scallions](/wiki/Scallion), [ginger](/wiki/Ginger) and [salt](/wiki/Salt).

The chicken is served chilled, often as an [appetizer](/wiki/Appetizer).
