The card is sold only to foreign motorists. As vehicle information is encoded in the card, it is not transferable between vehicles. It can also act as a [NETS](/wiki/NETS_(company)) CashCard (chip version) or NETS FlashPay card (contactless version) for all NETS retail transactions and paying [carparks](/wiki/Parking_lot) that uses the Electronic Parking System (EPS). ## Overview Autopass Cards slotted in In-vehicle units (IU) installed in the vehicle are automatically deducted when the vehicle passes through an ERP gantry. If one does not have an IU, they can take a daily pass to enter the ERP areas such as the [Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore). Autopass Cards are no longer sold at the primary clearance/immigration booths or VEP/Tolls office at the [Tuas](/wiki/Tuas_Checkpoint) and [Woodlands](/wiki/Woodlands_Checkpoint) checkpoints in Singapore. Motorists must apply through online on the OneMotoring website with valid road tax discs and insurance certificates for their cars when doing their application for the Autopass Card. - [Johor–Singapore Causeway](/wiki/Johor%E2%80%93Singapore_Causeway) This Singapore-related article is a stub.
