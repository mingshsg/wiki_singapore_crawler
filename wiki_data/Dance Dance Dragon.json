  "content": "2012 Singaporean film ***Dance Dance Dragon*** ([Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 龙众舞; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *lóng zhòng wǔ*) is a Singaporean comedy film from [Mediacorp Raintree Pictures](/wiki/Mediacorp_Raintree_Pictures) and [Golden Village Pictures](/wiki/Golden_Village) that was released for [Chinese New Year](/wiki/Chinese_New_Year) on 19 January 2012 in Singapore and in March in Malaysia. It is MediaCorp Raintree Pictures's last film. It was produced by most of the production team of *[It's a Great, Great World](/wiki/It%27s_a_Great,_Great_World)*. The cast includes artistes from both Singapore and Malaysia. ## Plot As [Chinese New Year](/wiki/Chinese_New_Year) 2012 marks the year of the [Dragon](/wiki/Dragon_(zodiac)), the film explores the Chinese's age-old obsession with the [Dragon](/wiki/Dragon_(zodiac)) and having children on a \"[Dragon](/wiki/Dragon_(zodiac)) year\" (see [Chinese zodiac](/wiki/Chinese_zodiac)). In the introduction, Ah Long ([Melvin Sia](/wiki/Melvin_Sia)) tells about how his father ([Zheng Geping](/wiki/Zheng_Geping)) was desperate to have a son born in the [Dragon](/wiki/Dragon_(zodiac)) year because his ancestors had decreed that only a \"[Dragon](/wiki/Dragon_(zodiac)) boy\" could take over the family's [Dragon Dance](/wiki/Dragon_dance) Association, known as Long Zhong Wu [Dragon Dance](/wiki/Dragon_dance) and [Lion Dance](/wiki/Lion_dance) Association (龙众舞舞龙舞狮团). His mother (younger, [Pan Lingling](/wiki/Pan_Lingling) and older, [Lai Meng](/wiki/Lai_Meng)) instead gives birth to \"[Dragon](/wiki/Dragon_(zodiac)) girls\" while Ah Long himself was born several seconds after the clock struck twelve, making him a \"[Snake](/wiki/Snake_(zodiac)) baby\", much to the disappointment of his father. At present time, Mother Long prays to the gods for blessings on her three children and pours out her desire for a grandchild. The oldest daughter Lucy, 48, is a spinster and can't find suitable work. The second daughter Ah Bee, 36, is a gambling addiction counselor who is tomboyish and was recently dumped by her boyfriend. The youngest and only son Ah Long is married but is terrified of children. Meanwhile, up in heaven, the gods are growing sick and tired of hearing Mother Long's daily prayers for a grandchild and deliberate whether to grant Mother Long her wish. ## Cast - [Lai Meng](/wiki/Lai_Meng) - [Kym Ng](/wiki/Kym_Ng) as Long Ah Bee - [Dennis Chew](/wiki/Dennis_Chew) as Lucy Long - [Adrian Pang](/wiki/Adrian_Pang) as Eric Tan - [Melvin Sia](/wiki/Melvin_Sia) as Ah Long - [Zheng Geping](/wiki/Zheng_Geping) - [Pan Lingling](/wiki/Pan_Lingling) - [Belinda Lee](/wiki/Belinda_Lee_(host)) as midwife - [Bryan Wong](/wiki/Bryan_Wong) as Uncle Teck - [Chen Huihui](/wiki/Chen_Huihui) - [Marcus Chin](/wiki/Marcus_Chin) as Ah Gui - [John Cheng](/wiki/John_Cheng) as Ah Gao - [Brandon Wong](/wiki/Brandon_Wong_(actor)) - [Patricia Mok](/wiki/Patricia_Mok) - [Dawn Yeoh](/wiki/Dawn_Yeoh) as Ah Long’s wife This article related to a Singaporean film is a stub.
