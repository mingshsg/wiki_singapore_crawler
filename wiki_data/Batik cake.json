  "content": "Malaysian dessert **Kek batik** (lit. '[Batik](/wiki/Batik) cake') is a type of Malaysian no-bake fridge cake [dessert](/wiki/Dessert) inspired by the Scottish [tiffin](/wiki/Tiffin_(confectionery)), brought in the country during the [British Malaya](/wiki/British_Malaya) and [Borneo](/wiki/British_Borneo) period, and adapted with Malaysian ingredients. This cake is made by mixing broken [Marie biscuits](/wiki/Marie_biscuit) combined with a chocolate sauce or runny custard made with [egg](/wiki/Egg), [butter](/wiki/Butter)/[margarine](/wiki/Margarine), [condensed milk](/wiki/Condensed_milk), [Milo](/wiki/Milo_(drink)) and [chocolate powders](/wiki/Cocoa_solids). The cake is served during special occasions like the [Eid al-Fitr](/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr) and [Christmas](/wiki/Christmas). ## History Batik cake is one of the very few Malaysian dishes that does not use any tropical ingredients. It is also similar to [hedgehog slice](/wiki/Hedgehog_slice) and the latest [Prince William](/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge) chocolate [biscuit cake](/wiki/Biscuit_cake), although with some different ingredients. In Brunei, the Batik cake is covered by green colour topping. - [Biscuit cake](/wiki/Biscuit_cake) - [Tinginys](/wiki/Tinginys) - [Chocolate biscuit pudding](/wiki/Chocolate_biscuit_pudding) - [Hedgehog slice](/wiki/Hedgehog_slice) - [Kiksekage](/wiki/Kiksekage) - [Kalte Schnauze](/wiki/Kalte_Schnauze) - Food portal - Malaysia portal This [Malaysian cuisine](/wiki/Malaysian_cuisine)-related article is a stub.
