It was opened on 15 October 2011 and was closed on 2 March 2020 to become part of the new [Singapore Oceanarium](/wiki/Singapore_Oceanarium), an expansion of the former [S.E.A. Aquarium](/wiki/S.E.A._Aquarium). ## Attractions The museum's main attraction was a 15m tall reconstruction of an ancient Chinese ship which is created based on historical accounts of Chinese mariner and diplomat,[Zheng He](/wiki/Zheng_He)'s journeys to the \"Western Ocean\" ([Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean)). Behind the Chinses ship was a replica of a 9th-century Arabian dhow, the [Jewel Of Muscat](/wiki/Jewel_of_Muscat), which was gifted to Singapore by the [Sultanate of Oman](/wiki/Oman). Surrounding both ships is the Souk Gallery which is a collection of dioramas of ancient markets in Vietnam, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Iran and Malindi in Africa . At the end of the gallery, the museum had a simulator, Typhoon Theatre, to let visitors experience what happened when a Chinese junk is caught in a storm. Visitors subsequently go down a water-themed walkway from the simulator into a gallery with artefacts recovered from a 13th-century wreck off Bakau in Indonesia. - [Jewel of Muscat](/wiki/Jewel_of_Muscat) - Official site Archived 2019-01-06 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine) - Website of the *Jewel of Muscat* This article related to a museum in Asia is a stub.
