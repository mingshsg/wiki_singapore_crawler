  "content": "Subzone of Rochor Planning Area in Singapore **Farrer Park** is a subzone of the [Rochor](/wiki/Rochor) planning area in the [Central Region](/wiki/Central_Region,_Singapore) of Singapore, as defined by the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority) bounded by [Serangoon Road](/wiki/Serangoon_Road), Rangoon Road, Race Course Road, Northumberland Road, Tekka Lane and [Bukit Timah Road](/wiki/Bukit_Timah_Road). The name \"Farrer Park\" historically referred to an open field situated to the west of this subzone, now commonly known as [Farrer Park Field](/wiki/Farrer_Park_Field), located within [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang) planning area. ## Etymology Farrer Park and Farrer Road were named after [R. J. Farrer](/wiki/Roland_John_Farrer) (died 1956), who was [Municipal](/wiki/Municipal) Assessor and later President of the Municipal [Commissioners](/wiki/Commissioner) in the 1920s. In 1952, there was an unsuccessful attempt to change the name of Farrer Road in order to avoid confusion with Farrer Park, situated in a different location. - [Little India, Singapore](/wiki/Little_India,_Singapore) - [Rochor](/wiki/Rochor) - Piccadilly Grand - National Heritage Board (2002), *Singapore's 100 Historic Places*, Archipelago Press, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-4068-23-3 - Victor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2004), *Toponymics - A Study of Singapore Street Names*, Eastern University Press, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-210-364-3 - Infopedia This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
