The building previously housed the [Lasallian](/wiki/De_La_Salle_Brothers) school [Saint Joseph's Institution](/wiki/Saint_Joseph%27s_Institution). However, it came into disuse after St. Joseph's Institution moved into a new campus on Malcolm Road in 1988. The building has since been restored and currently houses the [Singapore Art Museum](/wiki/Singapore_Art_Museum). ## Architecture Built on the site of a small Catholic chapel erected in the 1830s, the first in Singapore, the former Saint Joseph's Institution is another example of the work of a 19th-century [French](/wiki/France) [priest](/wiki/Priest)-[architect](/wiki/Architect), Brother Lothaire. Brother Lothaire was one of six Brothers, five Sisters and two young [missionaries](/wiki/Missionaries) who came to Singapore with Reverend Father Jean Marie Beurel on his return from [France](/wiki/France) in 1852 to found the new Catholic boys' school of Saint Joseph's Institution. When the school was first completed in 1867, the completed building which is the current central block comprised a two-storey rectangular block with a [pitched](/wiki/Pitch_(resin)) [roof](/wiki/Roof) and modest [belfry](/wiki/Bell_tower). In 1903-1906, Father [Charles Bénédict Nain](/wiki/Charles_B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dict_Nain), the then [parish](/wiki/Parish) priest, added two new semi-circular wings to match the [architectural](/wiki/Architectural) theme of the central block and to define the fine [Baroque](/wiki/Baroque) entrance [forecourt](/wiki/Courtyard) which is such an important part of the urban area in which it stands. This quality has been all but destroyed in recent years. In 1910, [verandahs](/wiki/Verandah) running along the whole length of the building were added at the rear, a large [dome](/wiki/Dome) built that replaced the old belfry was lined with [teak](/wiki/Teak) and the [cross](/wiki/Cross) was erected. New [pediments](/wiki/Pediment) and a [parapet](/wiki/Parapet) were also added. Brother Michael was responsible for the hall, [gymnasium](/wiki/Gym) and the chapel, which were added between 1911 and 1912. - National Heritage Board (2002), *Singapore's 100 Historic Places*, Archipelago Press, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-4068-23-3 - Norman Edwards, Peter Keys (1996), *Singapore - A Guide to Buildings, Streets, Places*, Times Books International, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 9971-65-231-5 - Preservation of Monuments Board, *Know Our Monuments* - Saint Joseph's Institution Online - Singapore Art Museum official website\n",
