  "content": "Coastal hill in Singapore **Mount Wallich** was a small coastal hill located near the southern coast of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). Survey maps from the late 1800's show the hill was located within the bounds of streets now known as: Reserve Road, Cecil Street, and [Telok Ayer Street](/wiki/Telok_Ayer_Street). ## History The hill was named after [Nathaniel Wallich](/wiki/Nathaniel_Wallich), a Dutch [surgeon](/wiki/Surgeon) and [botanist](/wiki/Botany) who fell ill on a trip to Singapore in 1822 and took up residence in a house at the top of the hill called Botany Hall. Over the next few months, Wallich helped [Sir Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles) submit a proposal to the government to establish the Singapore Botanical & Experimental Garden, a forerunner to the [Singapore Botanic Gardens](/wiki/Singapore_Botanic_Gardens). In the 1860s, work began on an ambitious project led by engineer George Collyer to build a [seawall](/wiki/Seawall) stretching from [Johnston's Pier](/wiki/Johnston%27s_Pier) to the old [Telok Ayer fish market](/wiki/Lau_Pa_Sat). In order to the build the structure, land seaward of Commercial Square (now [Raffles Place](/wiki/Raffles_Place)) was [reclaimed](/wiki/Land_reclamation) using dirt from Mount Wallich. The project was completed in 1864 and the area became known as [Collyer Quay](/wiki/Collyer_Quay). In 1885, Mount Wallich was levelled for the Telok Ayer Reclamation Scheme, a project to further expand Collyer Quay. It was a difficult and tedious project as the hills were rocky and the [Public Works Department](/wiki/Public_Works_Department_(Singapore)) (PWD) had to blast out parts of Mount Wallich. The area that was reclaimed would become the [Central Business District](/wiki/Downtown_Core) (CBD) of Singapore, as well as the areas where Raffles Quay, [Anson Road](/wiki/Anson,_Singapore), and [Robinson Road](/wiki/Robinson_Road,_Singapore) currently lie. 1°16′35″N 103°50′41″E﻿ / ﻿1.2764°N 103.8447°E﻿ / 1.2764; 103.8447\n",
