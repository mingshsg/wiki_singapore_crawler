The Myanmar community in Singapore is estimated to number at least 200,000, made up of students, healthcare workers and foreign domestic workers, as well as skilled professionals. The [Burmese Buddhist Temple](/wiki/Burmese_Buddhist_Temple_(Singapore)) in Singapore is Singapore's oldest [Theravada](/wiki/Theravada_Buddhism) institution founded in 1875 by a Burmese emigrant. The 10-tonne [Buddha image](/wiki/Buddha_in_art) within the temple was transported from [Mandalay](/wiki/Mandalay) in 1921 Today, it remains the only Burmese Buddhist temple built in the traditional Burmese style and serves as a landmark for many Burmese immigrants in Singapore. Peninsula Plaza, located close to Singapore's [former City Hall](/wiki/Former_City_Hall,_Singapore) is home to a Burmese enclave with traditional wear, Burmese restaurants and stores located inside the plaza's mall. The area was once home to [Tan Kim Ching](/wiki/Tan_Kim_Ching) and the Peninsula Plaza was built in 1979 and was designed to preserve the sea view from [Fort Canning](/wiki/Fort_Canning). It eventually became a hub for the local Myanmar community in the 1990s with early businesses and a Burmese-language library opening in the Plaza. Myanmar nationals in Singapore often work as [maids](/wiki/Maids), who are cheaper than their counterparts mainly because they typically lack full knowledge of the English language. These Burmese maids form their own communities, including four [Chin language](/wiki/Chin_language) Christian Churches within Singapore.\n",
