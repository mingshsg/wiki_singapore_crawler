  "content": "* *Qui-Lim Choo** ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 朱桂林) is a [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore)-born scientist, who along with [Michael Houghton](/wiki/Michael_Houghton_(virologist)), [George Kuo](/wiki/George_Kuo) and [Daniel W. Bradley](/wiki/Daniel_W._Bradley), co-discovered and cloned [Hepatitis C](/wiki/Hepatitis_C) in 1989. He also co-discovered the [Hepatitis D](/wiki/Hepatitis_D) [genome](/wiki/Genome) in 1986. The discovery of Hepatitis C led to the rapid development of diagnostic reagents to detect [Hepatitis C virus](/wiki/Hepatitis_C_virus) in blood supplies which has reduced the risk of acquiring hepatitis C through [blood transfusion](/wiki/Blood_transfusion) from one in three to about one in two million. It is estimated that antibody testing has prevented at least 40,000 new infections per year in the US alone and many more worldwide. ## Early life and education Choo received his undergraduate training at [Queen Elizabeth College](/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_College) in 1973 and completed his PhD in [biochemistry](/wiki/Biochemistry) at [King's College London](/wiki/King%27s_College_London) in 1980. He trained under [William J. Rutter](/wiki/William_J._Rutter) at the [University of California, San Francisco](/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco) before joining [Chiron Corporation](/wiki/Chiron_Corporation). ## Awards and recognition He was awarded the [Karl Landsteiner Memorial Award](/wiki/Karl_Landsteiner_Memorial_Award) (1992) and Dale A. Smith Memorial Award (2005) of the [American Association of Blood Banks](/wiki/AABB), and the [William Beaumont Prize](/wiki/William_Beaumont_Prize) of the [American Gastroenterological Association](/wiki/American_Gastroenterological_Association) in 1994.
