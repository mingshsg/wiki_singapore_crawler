It was first registered in September 1988. It is administered by the [Singapore Network Information Centre](/wiki/Singapore_Network_Information_Centre). Registrations are processed via accredited registrars. In 2011, two new [internationalized country code top-level domains](/wiki/Internationalized_country_code_top-level_domain) were registered for Singapore, intended for domain names in the local languages. These domains are .新加坡 (encoded as .xn—yfro4i67o) and .சிங்கப்பூர் (encoded as .xn—clchc0ea0b2g2a9gcd). ## Restrictions SGNIC requires that all .sg domains registered after 2 May 2013 have proof of Singaporean presence. This is facilitated by requiring the registrant to login to the Verified@SG portal with their SingPass account. ## Second-level domains - .com.sg – Commercial entities - .net.sg – Network providers and info-com operators - .org.sg – Organizations in the Registry of Societies - .gov.sg – Government entities - .edu.sg – Educational institutions - .per.sg – Personal domain names (retired as of March 2023) - .sg – Open to all with a valid Singapore postal address - .新加坡 – for [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language) websites - .சிங்கப்பூர் – for [Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_language) websites ## .sg domain statistics As of June 2025, there were 202,905 registered .sg domains. - IANA .sg whois information - Singapore Network Information Centre (SGNIC) This Singapore-related article is a stub.
