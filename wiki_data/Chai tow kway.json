Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *Find sources:* \"Chai tow kway\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(December 2013)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* ***Chai tow kway*** is a common dish or [dim sum](/wiki/Dim_sum) of [Chaoshan cuisine](/wiki/Teochew_cuisine) in [Chaoshan](/wiki/Chaoshan), [Guangdong](/wiki/Guangdong), [China](/wiki/China). It is also popular in [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand), [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan) and [Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam), consisting of [stir-fried](/wiki/Stir-fried) cubes of [radish cake](/wiki/Turnip_cake). In some places such as Singapore, it is confusingly translated as **carrot cake**[note 1] (compare with flour-based [cake](/wiki/Carrot_cake)). ## Ingredients It is made with [radish cake](/wiki/Radish_cake) (steamed [rice flour](/wiki/Rice_flour), water, and shredded white [daikon](/wiki/Daikon)), which is then stir-fried with eggs, preserved radish, and other seasonings. The radish cake is often served in large rectangular slabs which are steamed and then later fried whole. Alternatives to *chai tow kway* include those made of [taro](/wiki/Taro) or solely of rice flour. The radish cake can also be eaten on its own, either just steamed, or steamed and then pan-fried, as opposed to the steamed then wok-fried with other ingredients in *chai tow kway*. Both the steamed and pan-fried varieties are commonly served topped with spring onions. ## Variations The versions served by [hawkers](/wiki/Hawker_(trade)#Southeast_Asia) in [Johor](/wiki/Johor) and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), where [Teochew people](/wiki/Teochew_people) live, are typically prepared by frying the [daikon cake](/wiki/Daikon_cake) with chopped preserved [turnip](/wiki/Turnip), diced [garlic](/wiki/Garlic), eggs, and Chinese [fish sauce](/wiki/Fish_sauce) in place of [soya sauce](/wiki/Soya_sauce). Chopped [spring onion](/wiki/Scallion) is added just before serving. Northwards (e.g. in [Kuala Lumpur](/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur)), the same dish is darker due to the use of dark soya sauce, and [bean sprouts](/wiki/Bean_sprout) are added. In Singapore, however, it is more commonly cut into pieces and stir-fried with [eggs](/wiki/Egg_(food)), garlic, [spring onion](/wiki/Spring_onion) and occasionally [shrimp](/wiki/Shrimp) (both dried and fresh). There are two variants: the \"white\" version does not use sweet soy sauce, and the radish cake is fried on top of a beaten egg to form a crust; the \"black\" version uses sweet sauce (molasses), and the egg is simply mixed in with the radish cake. ## Cultural importance The dish is popular in Singapore and Malaysia, enjoyed by Teochews as well as people of various dialects and races, and served in both hawker stalls and upscale Chinese restaurants. It is a much-loved local comfort food in the region, and can be consumed at various times of the day; it goes from being a breakfast dish, to a main lunch dish, to a late-night supper dish. Many public figures are also known to have a fondness for the dish. Notably, the Singaporean politician [Chan Chun Sing](/wiki/Chan_Chun_Sing) declared his love for the dish in one of his speeches, specifying a preference of a particular variant of the dish (the \"S$10 [XO sauce](/wiki/XO_sauce) chye tow kuay\"), as opposed to the one commonly found in hawker centres and coffee shops, thus illustrating the many variations of the dish available in the region. - Food portal - Asia portal - [Bánh bột chiên](/wiki/B%C3%A1nh_b%E1%BB%99t_chi%C3%AAn) - [Turnip cake](/wiki/Turnip_cake), a similar variety of [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese_cuisine) [dim sum](/wiki/Dim_sum), using the same *[lobak](/wiki/Lobak)* (more commonly known as [daikon](/wiki/Daikon)) and rice flour ## Notes\n",
