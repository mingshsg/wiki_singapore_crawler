Established in 2002, the camp is operated by the [Republic of Singapore Air Force](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force) (RSAF). The camp houses elements from [Air Defence Operations Command](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force#Air_Defence_&_Operations_Command_(ADOC)) (HQ ADOC, 165 Squadron, 809 and 819 Squadrons and 9 Air Engineering and Logistics Group) and [Participation Command](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force#Participation_Command_(PC)) (HQ PC, 3DA, 6/9 DA and 18 DA Battalions, 105 Squadron and 1 Medical Squadron). The camp was originally known as the Air Defence Systems Division (ADSD) complex. There still exists a road sign along Sembawang Road with this name. The elements were then transferred to Air Defence Operations Command (ADOC) in early 2007, and later, 3 Battalions were transferred to Participation Command (PC) in August that year.
