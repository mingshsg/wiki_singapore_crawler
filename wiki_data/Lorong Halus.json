  "content": "Subzone of Hougang Planning Area in Singapore **Lorong Halus** is an area in [Pasir Ris](/wiki/Pasir_Ris) surrounding a road of the same name. The road leads to industrial buildings and farms in Pasir Ris Farmway. It starts from the [Tampines Expressway](/wiki/Tampines_Expressway) (TPE) and ends at a pier. There is a road from Lorong Halus that leads to the Lorong Halus Wetland. The [wetland](/wiki/Wetland) treats the water flowing through it, which was a former [landfill](/wiki/Landfill). The nearest MRT station to Lorong Halus is [Pasir Ris MRT station](/wiki/Pasir_Ris_MRT_station) while the nearest LRT station is [Riviera LRT station](/wiki/Riviera_LRT_station). ## History Lorong Halus means “Thin/Tiny Lane” in [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language). In the 1970s, Lorong Halus was predominantly a farming area with several Malay rural villages such as Kampong Sungei Blukar and Kampong Teban, ponds and coconut and rubber [plantations](/wiki/Plantation). A large part of the area had formerly been used as a sewage ground (for night-soil collection) and a refuse dump. The sewage ground was shut down in the 1980s following the end of the local night-soil industry in Singapore at around that time, while the dumping ground was closed down on 31 March 1999, and since then all of Singapore's garbage has been sent to Pulau Semakau Landfill (incinerated beforehand) just off the mainland's southern coast. Today, much of the area has been restored to its original natural state as a coastal wetland open to the general public. - [Pasir Ris](/wiki/Pasir_Ris) - [Tampines Expressway](/wiki/Tampines_Expressway) - Lorong Halus Wetland\n",
