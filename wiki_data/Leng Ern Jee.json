  "content": "Buddhist temple **Leng Ern Jee** is a [Dejiao](/wiki/De_teaching) temple located along Jalan Rajah in [Balestier, Singapore](/wiki/Balestier). ## History Originally located along Circular Road, the temple began as a shrine in the upper floor of a shophouse dedicated to [Lu Dong Bin](/wiki/Lu_Dong_Bin) and [Ji Gong](/wiki/Ji_Gong) during the [Japanese occupation of Singapore](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore). After World War 2, donation was collected to move the temple to Jalan Rajah. A [traditional Chinese medicine](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) clinic was opened in 1969. The main temple hall is devoted to Lu Dong Bin and Ji Gong, the rear hall is used for honouring ancestors, and the second floor is dedicated to [Guanyin](/wiki/Guanyin). The temple is included in the Balestier Heritage Trail by the [National Heritage Board](/wiki/National_Heritage_Board_(Singapore)). This article about a Singapore building or structure is a stub.
