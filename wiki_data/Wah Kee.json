According to the History of Wah Kee, Wah Kee (华记) was created in Singapore by Sū Guǎnghuá (苏广华). His associate Zhào Guǎnghéng (赵广恒) created Guǎng Jì (广记) in [Guangzhou](/wiki/Guangzhou), China, while Guān Fúshèng (关福胜) created Shèng Jì (胜记) in [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand), and Zhāng Xióngjié (张雄杰) created Jié Jì (杰记) in [Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam). In the 1950s, they operated openly in the area around [Bentong](/wiki/Bentong) and placed a member on the local council of [Jemaluang](/wiki/Jemaluang). During this time, they were commonly associated with the [Malaysian Chinese Association](/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese_Association), with politician [D. R. Seenivasagam](/wiki/D._R._Seenivasagam) going so far as to describe this connection in Parliament.
