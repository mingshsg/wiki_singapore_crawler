  "content": "The **regions of Singapore** serve as [urban planning](/wiki/Urban_planning) subdivisions of the country at the highest level as demarcated by the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority) (URA) to support its planning work. Over time, other government agencies have also adopted these five regions for administrative purposes, such as the [Department of Statistics](/wiki/Statistics_Singapore) in conducting [censuses](/wiki/Census). [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore)'s regions are further subdivided into 55 [planning areas](/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore) on the second level, which include two [water catchment](/wiki/Drainage_basin) areas, and planning areas are further divided into [subzones](/wiki/Subzones_of_Singapore) on the lowest level. The largest region in terms of area is the [West Region](/wiki/West_Region,_Singapore) with 218.4 km2 (84.3 sq mi), while the [Central Region](/wiki/Central_Region,_Singapore) is the most populous with an estimated population of 922,980 inhabitants in the area in 2019. The country is governed as a [unitary state](/wiki/Unitary_state) without [provinces](/wiki/Province) or [states](/wiki/State_(administrative_division)). While referenced by some government organisations, these regions are not formal administrative subdivisions but are mainly geographical in nature or used for urban planning. For [local governance](/wiki/Local_governance), Singapore is divided into five [Community Development Council](/wiki/Community_Development_Council) (CDC) [districts](/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Singapore#Community_Development_Council_Districts) on the second level, each headed by a [mayor](/wiki/Community_Development_Council#Mayors). These districts are made up of [electoral constituencies](/wiki/Constituencies_of_Singapore), which are administered at the lowest level by [town councils](/wiki/Town_Council_(Singapore)). A town council may oversee one or more constituencies, and its boundaries do not necessarily align with those of CDC districts. CDC mayors are not directly elected but are [Members of Parliament](/wiki/Members_of_Parliament_(Singapore)) (MPs) representing constituencies within their respective districts.[a] Electoral boundaries can change with each [general election](/wiki/General_elections_in_Singapore), while regional and planning area boundaries have remained largely fixed. ## Regional centres Before 1991, [urban planning in Singapore](/wiki/Urban_planning_in_Singapore) prioritised a strong commercial core within the [Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore), which had functioned as the city's economic centre since the [Jackson Plan](/wiki/Jackson_Plan). At the same time, residential areas were largely concentrated in the north and east while industrial zones were mainly located in the west. This spatial separation meant that many Singaporeans had to travel long distances across the island for work, shopping or daily activities. To mitigate these inefficiencies and improve the overall balance of development, the concept of regional centres was introduced under the 1991 Master Plan. Internationally, regional centres are usually planned as new urban areas or largely self contained towns with a full range of urban functions. In Singapore, however, its limited land area of roughly 780 km2 (300 sq mi) gives the term a more localised meaning. A regional centre functions as a secondary downtown that sits between town centres in new residential towns and the main [central business district](/wiki/Downtown_Core) (CBD) within the [Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore). These centres are intended to provide a wide range of commercial, retail, leisure and community facilities for surrounding residents. They are located in areas with strong connectivity through the [Mass Rapid Transit](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) (MRT) system, an [efficient bus system](/wiki/Public_buses_of_Singapore) and an [extensive road network](/wiki/Expressways_in_Singapore). The broader objective of regional centres is to decentralise amenities that were previously concentrated in the city-centre. There are currently four regional centres in Singapore, first identified in the 1991 Master Plan. There is no designated regional centre for the [Central Region](/wiki/Central_Region,_Singapore), as the city-centre itself functions *[de facto](/wiki/De_facto)* as one. The first regional centre to be developed was [Tampines](/wiki/Tampines), located in the [east](/wiki/East_Region,_Singapore). This was followed by [Jurong East](/wiki/Jurong_East) in the [west](/wiki/West_Region,_Singapore), with parts of the area also known as the Jurong Lake District (JLD). [Woodlands](/wiki/Woodlands,_Singapore) in the [north](/wiki/North_Region,_Singapore) was made a regional centre. Plans for [Seletar](/wiki/Seletar) in the [north-east](/wiki/North-East_Region,_Singapore) have yet to be formally announced and, in the interim, [Punggol](/wiki/Punggol) functions *de facto* as the regional centre for the north-east, including the [Punggol Digital District](/wiki/Punggol_Digital_District) (PDD). ## List of regions RegionRegional centreLargest PA by areaLargest PA by populationArea (km2)Estimated Population Population density (/km2)Planning Areas[Central Region](/wiki/Central_Region,_Singapore)**None** (*de jure*); **[Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore)** (*de facto*)[Queenstown](/wiki/Queenstown,_Singapore)[Bukit Merah](/wiki/Bukit_Merah)132.7922,580[b]6,95222[East Region](/wiki/East_Region,_Singapore)**[Tampines](/wiki/Tampines)**[Changi](/wiki/Changi)[Bedok](/wiki/Bedok)128.3685,890[b]7,3676[North Region](/wiki/North_Region,_Singapore)**[Woodlands](/wiki/Woodlands,_Singapore)**[Central Water Catchment](/wiki/Central_Water_Catchment)[Woodlands](/wiki/Woodlands,_Singapore)134.5582,330[b]4,3308[North-East Region](/wiki/North-East_Region,_Singapore)**[Seletar](/wiki/Seletar)** (*de jure*); **[Punggol](/wiki/Punggol)** (*de facto*)[North-Eastern Islands](/wiki/North-Eastern_Islands)[Sengkang](/wiki/Sengkang)121.3930,910[b]8,9609[West Region](/wiki/West_Region,_Singapore)**[Jurong East](/wiki/Jurong_East)**[Western Water Catchment](/wiki/Western_Water_Catchment)[Jurong West](/wiki/Jurong_West)218.4922,540[b]4,58312**Total**735.24,044,250[b]6,07755 - Singapore portal - [Administrative divisions of Singapore](/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Singapore) - [Urban planning in Singapore](/wiki/Urban_planning_in_Singapore) - [Urban renewal in Singapore](/wiki/Urban_renewal_in_Singapore) - [Future developments in Singapore](/wiki/Future_developments_in_Singapore) - [Land reclamation in Singapore](/wiki/Land_reclamation_in_Singapore) - [Geography of Singapore](/wiki/Geography_of_Singapore) ## Notes - Urban Redevelopment Authority - Google Maps of the Regions of Singapore\n",
