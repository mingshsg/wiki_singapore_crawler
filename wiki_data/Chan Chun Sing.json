Being one of the four top scorers from Raffles Junior College in the [A-Level](/wiki/Singapore-Cambridge_GCE_Advanced_Level) examination in 1987, Chan was awarded the [President's Scholarship](/wiki/President%27s_Scholar) and [Singapore Armed Forces Overseas Scholarship](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces_Overseas_Scholarship) in 1988.

Chan excelled as a student at the [United States Army Command and General Staff College](/wiki/United_States_Army_Command_and_General_Staff_College) in 1998, and was the first foreign student to be conferred the Distinguished Master Strategist Award in the same year. On 26 March 2010, Chan was appointed [Chief of Army](/wiki/Singapore_Army#List_of_chiefs_of_Army). He stepped down from his post and left the Singapore Armed Forces on 25 March 2011 in order to contest in the [2011 general election](/wiki/2011_Singaporean_general_election). ## Political career Chan made his political debut in the [2011 general election](/wiki/2011_Singaporean_general_election) as part of the five-member [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) team led by [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) contesting in [Tanjong Pagar GRC](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar_Group_Representation_Constituency). He represented the [Buona Vista](/wiki/Buona_Vista) ward, which was previously held by [Lim Swee Say](/wiki/Lim_Swee_Say). The PAP team won by an uncontested walkover as none of the opposition parties contested Tanjong Pagar GRC. During the election campaign, Chan used the [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) phrase \"*kee chiu*\" (\"hands up\") at a rally to engage the crowd, and the term became a nickname for him. Following the 2011 general election, Chan was appointed [Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports](/wiki/Ministry_of_Community_Development,_Youth_and_Sports), and [Minister of State for Communications and the Arts](/wiki/Ministry_of_Information,_Communications_and_the_Arts). Chan, then 42, was one of the youngest ministers to be appointed to the [Cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Singapore). On 31 July 2012, Chan relinquished his portfolio in the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts and was appointed [Senior Minister of State for Defence](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Singapore)). Following a restructuring of government ministries in November 2012, he began heading the newly created [Ministry of Social and Family Development](/wiki/Ministry_of_Social_and_Family_Development) as Acting Minister. He was promoted to full Minister in September 2013, and concurrently served as Second Minister for Defence. On 23 January 2015, Chan joined the [National Trades Union Congress](/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress) (NTUC) on a part-time basis; He was appointed as NTUC's deputy secretary-general on 27 January 2015 and joined NTUC full-time from April 2015. On 1 October 2015, following the [2015 general election](/wiki/2015_Singaporean_general_election), Chan was appointed Deputy Chairman of the [People's Association](/wiki/People%27s_Association), a role which he held till 2021 before relinquishing it to [Edwin Tong](/wiki/Edwin_Tong). In the same year, Chan was put in charge of leading the PAP team in Tanjong Pagar GRC after [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) died in March 2015. On 23 November 2018, Chan succeeded [Tharman Shanmugaratnam](/wiki/Tharman_Shanmugaratnam) as the PAP's Second Assistant Secretary-General (alongside [Heng Swee Keat](/wiki/Heng_Swee_Keat)). In the lead-up to the [2020 general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election), Chan was widely seen as one of the three leading candidates (alongside Heng and [Ong Ye Kung](/wiki/Ong_Ye_Kung)) to succeed [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) as [Prime Minister of Singapore](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore). ### Minister for Social and Family Development Chan has announced three key priorities for his Ministry in the Committee of Supply debate 2014. These priorities are: (i) to maintain the currency and adequacy of Singapore's social support policies, (ii) to deliver integrated social services and (iii) to develop manpower for the social service sector. Chan launched the first of 23 Social Service Offices to bring social assistance touch points closer to the populace. The tender evaluation process was revised for commercial childcare centres. The joint effort by [Early Childhood Development Agency](/wiki/Early_Childhood_Development_Agency) and [Housing Development Board](/wiki/Housing_Development_Board) aimed to keep rental costs in HDB estates manageable, and in turn keep childcare programmes affordable. More infrastructure support to benefit non-Anchor Operators (AOP) setting up preschools in high demand areas and workplaces. Non-AOPs who provide quality and affordable programmes can tap on a Teaching & Learning Resources Grant of up to S$4,000 per year for materials and equipment. During a Parliament session in 2017, responding to a raised question, he replied that there will be no change to an existing policy, that single mothers will continue to get only eight of the 16 weeks paid maternity leave that married mothers are entitled to, and will still not be entitled to claim a child relief tax incentive. ### Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan held the position of [Minister in the Prime Minister's Office](/wiki/Prime_Minister%27s_Office_(Singapore)) ([minister without portfolio](/wiki/Minister_without_portfolio)) from 9 April 2015 to 30 April 2018. He was also Secretary General of the [National Trades Union Congress](/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress) (NTUC) from 4 May 2015 to 30 April 2018. ### Minister for Trade and Industry On 24 April 2018, it was announced that Chan would succeed [Lim Hng Kiang](/wiki/Lim_Hng_Kiang) and [S. Iswaran](/wiki/S._Iswaran) as the [Minister for Trade and Industry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Trade_and_Industry_(Singapore)), and would relinquish his NTUC chief portfolio to [Ng Chee Meng](/wiki/Ng_Chee_Meng), effective from 1 May 2018. He also took over responsibility for the Public Service Division on the same day as well. An audio leak from a closed-door meeting between Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) members and minister Chan Chun Sing on 18 February 2020 revealed that Chan had used the derogatory [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien) term \"sia suay\" (meaning causing embarrassment or disgrace) to describe Singaporeans who were panic buying. In late May 2020, Chan gave a video interview in which he sought to explain why Singapore was heavily reliant on foreign trade. He cited face masks as an example of a product which Singapore could not produce itself, explaining that \"[we] don't have too many sheep in Singapore to produce cotton\". Online commentators were quick to point out that cotton is produced by cotton plants rather than from sheep. On 1 June 2020, Chan published a Facebook post apologising for his gaffe and clarified: \"To any one (especially young children) watching the video – cotton definitely doesn't come from sheep, it comes from cotton plants!\". Another audio leak happened two days before the [2020 general election](/wiki/2020_Singaporean_general_election). In early July 2020, [The Online Citizen](/wiki/The_Online_Citizen) published an article along with an audio clip of a speech made by Chan. In the audio clip, Chan mentioned the PAP's results during elections and the restricting space access north of [Seletar Airport](/wiki/Seletar_Airport). Chan later wrote on [Facebook](/wiki/Facebook) that the speech took place in 2019 at a closed-door conversation held after Malaysia imposing a restricted flying zone north of Seletar Airport. He claimed that the audio clip was leaked and circulated for \"ill-intent\". Following the General Election, Chan retained his portfolio. ### Minister for Education Following a [Cabinet reshuffle](/wiki/Fifth_Lee_Hsien_Loong_Cabinet) on 15 May 2021, Chan was succeeded by [Gan Kim Yong](/wiki/Gan_Kim_Yong) as Minister for Trade and Industry while he succeeded [Lawrence Wong](/wiki/Lawrence_Wong) as [Minister for Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)). On 19 July 2021, Chan visited [River Valley High School, Singapore](/wiki/River_Valley_High_School,_Singapore) in response to an [attack](/wiki/River_Valley_High_School_attack) conducted by a student earlier during the day. A week later, Chan gave a Ministerial Statement in response to the attack. Chan also announced the removal of Common Last Topics from the GCE N, O and A-Levels, and some topics from the final year examinations \"to help ease stress\" as well as a proposed buddy system to be implemented in schools later on. On 5 August 2024, it was announced that the Ministry of Education would be removing the application, Mobile Guardian, from all students’ Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) which were installed with the app as a precaution following an incident on 4 August where 13 000 students from 26 schools had their devices wiped remotely by a perpetrator as part of a cybersecurity breach into Mobile Guardian. Subsequently, MOE terminated their contract with Mobile Guardian on 9 September. This follows a data breach incident in April where data of students and parents from 127 schools were compromised. As well as a human error in configuration on Mobile Guardian’s end which led to a second cybersecurity incident in end July. Chan subsequently gave a statement in Parliament regarding all 3 incidents during a Parliament Sitting on 9 September. ### Minister for Defence Following to the [2025 general election](/wiki/2025_Singaporean_general_election), Chan was appointed as Defence Minister replacing retiring [Ng Eng Hen](/wiki/Ng_Eng_Hen) on 23 May 2025. Chan delivered the closing speech at the 22nd Shangri-la Dialogue on 1 June 2025. ## Notes - Chan Chun Sing on Prime Minister's Office - Chan Chun Sing on [Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore) Political officesPreceded by[Vivian Balakrishnan](/wiki/Vivian_Balakrishnan) **[Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports](/wiki/Minister_for_Community_Development,_Youth_and_Sports) Acting** 2011–2012**Restructured** **New office** **[Minister for Social and Family Development](/wiki/Ministry_of_Social_and_Family_Development)** 2013–2015 Acting: 2012–2013Succeeded by[Tan Chuan-Jin](/wiki/Tan_Chuan-Jin)Preceded by[Lim Swee Say](/wiki/Lim_Swee_Say) **[Minister in the Prime Minister's Office](/wiki/Prime_Minister%27s_Office_(Singapore))** 2015–2018Succeeded by[Ng Chee Meng](/wiki/Ng_Chee_Meng) [Indranee Rajah](/wiki/Indranee_Rajah)Preceded by[Lim Hng Kiang](/wiki/Lim_Hng_Kiang) **[Minister for Trade and Industry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Trade_and_Industry_(Singapore))** 2018–2021Succeeded by[Gan Kim Yong](/wiki/Gan_Kim_Yong)Preceded by[Lawrence Wong](/wiki/Lawrence_Wong) **[Minister for Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore))** 2021–2025Succeeded by[Desmond Lee](/wiki/Desmond_Lee_(Singaporean_politician))Preceded by[Ng Eng Hen](/wiki/Ng_Eng_Hen) **[Minister for Defence](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Singapore))** 2025–present**Incumbent****New title** **[Coordinating Minister for Public Services](/wiki/Coordinating_Minister_for_Public_Services)** 2025–present**Incumbent**[Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore)Preceded by[Lui Tuck Yew](/wiki/Lui_Tuck_Yew) [Baey Yam Keng](/wiki/Baey_Yam_Keng) [Sam Tan](/wiki/Sam_Tan_(politician)) [Indranee Rajah](/wiki/Indranee_Rajah) [Koo Tsai Kee](/wiki/Koo_Tsai_Kee) [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) **Member of Parliament for [Tanjong Pagar GRC](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar_GRC)** 2011–present Served alongside: **(2011-2015): [Lily Neo](/wiki/Lily_Neo), [Chia Shi-Lu](/wiki/Chia_Shi-Lu), [Indranee Rajah](/wiki/Indranee_Rajah), [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) (2015-2020): [Joan Pereira](/wiki/Joan_Pereira), [Melvin Yong](/wiki/Melvin_Yong), Chia Shi-Lu, Indranee Rajah (2020-2025): Joan Pereira, [Alvin Tan](/wiki/Alvin_Tan_(politician)), [Eric Chua](/wiki/Eric_Chua), Indranee Rajah (2025-present): Joan Pereira, Alvin Tan, [Foo Cexiang](/wiki/Foo_Cexiang), [Rachel Ong](/wiki/Rachel_Ong)****Incumbent**Party political officesPreceded by[Teo Ser Luck](/wiki/Teo_Ser_Luck) **Chairman of [Young PAP](/wiki/Young_PAP)** 2008–2017Succeeded by[Janil Puthucheary](/wiki/Janil_Puthucheary)Trade union officesPreceded by[Lim Swee Say](/wiki/Lim_Swee_Say) **Secretary-General of the [National Trades Union Congress](/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress)** 2015–2018Succeeded by[Ng Chee Meng](/wiki/Ng_Chee_Meng)Military officesPreceded by[Neo Kian Hong](/wiki/Neo_Kian_Hong) **Chief of the [Singapore Army](/wiki/Singapore_Army)** 2010–2011Succeeded by[Ravinder Singh](/wiki/Ravinder_Singh_(general))\n",
