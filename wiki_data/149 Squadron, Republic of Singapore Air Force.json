The squadron goes by the [motto](/wiki/Motto) \"*Steadfast*\" with the [Shikra](/wiki/Shikra) adopted as its mascot. ## History Based at [Paya Lebar Air Base](/wiki/Paya_Lebar_Air_Base), 149 Squadron was inaugurated on 1 June 1985 as one of the RSAF's fighter squadrons operating in the interceptor role. The squadron initially operated the supersonic [F-5E/F Tiger II](/wiki/Northrop_F-5#F-5E_and_F-5F_Tiger_II) fighter aircraft, before converting to the improved [F-5S/T Tiger-IIs](/wiki/Northrop_F-5#Upgrades) fighter aircraft in the early 1990s, these were retrofitted with new state-of-the-art avionics giving the aircraft capability of carrying out both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. On 5 April 2010, the squadron was re-inaugurated by Defence Minister [Teo Chee Hean](/wiki/Teo_Chee_Hean) in an RSAF ceremony at Paya Lebar Air Base, with the arrival of five [F-15SG](/wiki/F-15E_Strike_Eagle#F-15SG) [strike fighters](/wiki/Strike_fighter) flown back the week before from [Mountain Home Air Force Base](/wiki/Mountain_Home_Air_Force_Base) in the United States. ## Information The tail is adorned with a beige checkered tailband. The squadron's logo is centered with the serial number on the base of the tail. ## Achievements The squadron found itself actively involved in several major multilateral exercises such as Exercise Bersama Shield and Bersama Lima under the ambit of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), and Exercise Cope Tiger with the US and Thailand air forces in 2007.
