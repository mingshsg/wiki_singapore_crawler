  "content": "Subzone of Kallang Planning Area in Central Region, Singapore **Kampong Bugis** ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language): *Kampung Bugis*, [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 甘榜武吉士; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *Gān Bǎng Wǔ Jí Shì*, [Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_language): கம்போங் பூகிஸ்) is a subzone within the planning area of [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang), [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), as defined by the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority) (URA). This subzone is bounded by [Kallang Road](/wiki/Kallang_Road) and [Sims Avenue](/wiki/Sims_Avenue) in the north; the [Kallang–Paya Lebar Expressway](/wiki/Kallang%E2%80%93Paya_Lebar_Expressway) (KPE) and Sims Way in the east; [Nicoll Highway](/wiki/Nicoll_Highway) in the south; and Crawford Street in the west. Kampong Bugis is probably best known for being the location of the former [Kallang Gasworks](/wiki/Kallang_Gasworks), the conserved [Kallang Airport](/wiki/Kallang_Airport) complex, as well as the former [Gay World Amusement Park](/wiki/Gay_World_Amusement_Park). A plot of land bounded by Kallang Road, the [Kallang River](/wiki/Kallang_River) and [Rochor River](/wiki/Rochor_River) is slated for future residential development, part of a pilot programme to create a car-lite riverside community. Other notable places in Kampong Bugis include [Kallang Riverside Park](/wiki/Kallang_Riverside_Park), [Merdeka Bridge](/wiki/Merdeka_Bridge,_Singapore) and Lorong 1 Geylang Bus Terminal. ## Etymology This subzone took its name from a similarly named road located within its boundary. The road itself derived its name from an expunged [Buginese](/wiki/Bugis) settlement that once sat on the mouth of the Kallang River. ## History The [Buginese](/wiki/Bugis) people came from [Sulawesi](/wiki/Sulawesi), in modern-day [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), and exercised control over islands in the [Riau Archipelago](/wiki/Riau_Archipelago). In 1819, a Buginese leader had a conflict with the [Dutch](/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies) colonist and was subsequently executed. The Buginese people rebelled against the Dutch in the wake of the execution, but was met fiercely with Dutch military action. The group fled to [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), first settling temporarily near present-day [Raffles Hotel](/wiki/Raffles_Hotel), later moving to where Bugis Street is, before finally building a large settlement by the [Kallang River](/wiki/Kallang_River) in today's Kampong Bugis (literally \"Bugis Village\"). In the early 1950s, a major fire destroyed the Buginese village. This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it. - v - t - e\n",
