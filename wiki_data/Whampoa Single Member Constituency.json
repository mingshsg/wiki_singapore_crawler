At abolition, it was managed by Moulmein–Kallang [Town Council](/wiki/Town_Council_(Singapore)). ## History In 1968, **Whampoa Constituency** was formed by carving out of [Kallang Constituency](/wiki/Kallang_Single_Member_Constituency). In 1988, it was renamed as **Whampoa Single Member Constituency** as part of Singapore's political reforms. It existed for another term until 1991 when it was abolished and divided into [Kampong Glam](/wiki/Kampong_Glam_Group_Representation_Constituency), [Jalan Besar](/wiki/Jalan_Besar_Group_Representation_Constituency) and [Toa Payoh](/wiki/Toa_Payoh_Group_Representation_Constituency) Group Representation Constituencies. In 2011, Whampoa Single Member Constituency was recreated by carving out from [Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency](/wiki/Jalan_Besar_Group_Representation_Constituency) (GRC) as Jalan Besar GRC was dissolved and was replaced by Moulmein–Kallang and Tanjong Pagar GRCs respectively. [Heng Chee How](/wiki/Heng_Chee_How) contested as a solo PAP candidate in the newly formed Whampoa SMC and won with 66.1% of the vote against the [National Solidarity Party](/wiki/National_Solidarity_Party_(Singapore))'s Ken Sun. This was despite a national swing against the PAP. It was later merged back to the revived Jalan Besar GRC again in the [2015 Singaporean general election](/wiki/2015_Singaporean_general_election). ## Member of Parliament YearMemberParty**Formation****1968**Buang bin Omar Junid[PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)**1972**Augustine Tan Hui Heng**1976****1980****1984****1988****Constituency abolished (1991– 2011)****2011**[Heng Chee How](/wiki/Heng_Chee_How)[PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)**Constituency abolished (2015)** ## Electoral results Note: The [Elections Department](/wiki/Elections_Department_Singapore) does not include rejected votes when calculating the vote shares of candidates.
