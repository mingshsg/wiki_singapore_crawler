The chief minister was the party leader of the majority in the [Legislative Assembly](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore). ## Background In February 1955, a new constitution, the [Rendel Constitution](/wiki/Rendel_Constitution), was implemented. Singapore would create its first [Legislative Assembly](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore) with majority of the seats popularly elected, to replace the existing [Legislative Council](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_Singapore). 25 out of 32 seats would be elected by the general populace, four seats would be allocated to unofficial members appointed by the [governor](/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Singapore), three seats taken by [*ex officio* members](/wiki/Ex_officio_member), respectively the [chief secretary](/wiki/Chief_Secretary,_Singapore), [attorney-general](/wiki/Attorney-General_of_Singapore) and [financial secretary](/wiki/Financial_secretary), while the remaining seat would be for the unofficial speaker of the Assembly nominated by the governor. Moreover, the office of Chief Minister was added, which would be assumed by the leader of the majority party in the Assembly, sharing the responsibility with Chief Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary. The chief secretary continued to take control over areas such as foreign affairs, defense, administration, internal security, broadcasting and public relations, whereas the power of policy-making for the people's welfare lay in the hands of the chief minister. ## List of chief ministers №NameTerm of officePolitical partyGovernmentElectedTook officeLeft officeGen.1**[David Marshall](/wiki/David_Marshall_(Singaporean_politician))** (1908–1995) Assemblyman for [Cairnhill](/wiki/Cairnhill_Single_Member_Constituency)6 April 19557 June 1956[LF](/wiki/Labour_Front)[Marshall I](/wiki/First_David_Marshall_Cabinet) [LF](/wiki/Labour_Front)–[UMNO](/wiki/Pertubuhan_Kebangsaan_Melayu_Singapura)-[MCA](/wiki/Malaysian_Chinese_Association)(/wiki/1955_Singaporean_general_election)The first Chief Minister of Singapore, he led the [Labour Front](/wiki/Labour_Front) to victory in the [1955 general election](/wiki/1955_Singaporean_general_election).
