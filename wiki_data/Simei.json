It means \"[Four Beauties](/wiki/Four_Beauties)\" in Chinese. Formerly called **Tampines South**, the area was officially renamed Simei in 1985 during the government's policy of \"[pinyinisation](/wiki/Speak_Mandarin_Campaign)\" in the 1980s, similar to the renaming of Nee Soon to [Yishun](/wiki/Yishun). Simei used to be a [Malay](/wiki/Malay_people) [kampong](/wiki/Kampong). A large part of it was a Chinese cemetery called Hwa San Tng. It was cleared in February 1982 to make way for the [public housing](/wiki/Public_housing_in_Singapore) estate at Simei. For a brief period, the roads in the estate were named after the legendary [Four Beauties](/wiki/Four_Beauties) (i.e. [Xi Shi](/wiki/Xi_Shi), [Wang Zhaojun](/wiki/Wang_Zhaojun), [Diaochan](/wiki/Diaochan) and [Yang Guifei](/wiki/Yang_Guifei)) in Chinese history. These confusing names were swiftly changed following complaints. ## Facilities Simei is a well-developed estate with plenty of amenities and facilities. There are schools, an MRT station, coffee shops and a shopping mall, [Eastpoint Mall](/wiki/Eastpoint_Mall,_Singapore).

There are different kinds of residential dwellings in the area, comprising landed properties, condominiums, mansions and public housing flats. For medical needs, [Changi General Hospital](/wiki/Changi_General_Hospital) is located here as well, and serves many Singaporeans living in the eastern area. ## Amenities There are wide range of amenities at Simei, including [Changi General Hospital](/wiki/Changi_General_Hospital) (CGH), retail outlets and the Changi Simei Community Club.
