Specifically in Singapore, it is commonly known as **cai png**, from the [Hokkien](/wiki/Hokkien_language) 菜饭; *cài fàn*; *chhài-pn̄g*. In recent times, due to [COVID-19](/wiki/COVID-19) restrictions and the associated economic effect, this concept has also become popular in [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong). Economy rice stalls typically consist of a case containing anywhere from 10 to 15 troughs of cooked dishes, including meat, seafood, vegetables, eggs and [tofu](/wiki/Tofu). Customers select any combination of these dishes, which are served accompanied by a portion of steamed white rice. Customers also have the option of a serving of curry or gravy to be served atop the steamed rice. In Singapore, it is more common to find the food on open troughs kept warm by hot water and an electric heater below. ## Origins Economy rice is thought of as a predominantly Chinese food; it is roughly analogous to the Malay or Indonesian concept of [nasi padang](/wiki/Nasi_padang) or [nasi campur](/wiki/Nasi_campur) ([mixed rice](/wiki/Mixed_rice)). It is what most Chinese Malaysians and Singaporeans think of when they refer to \"home-cooked\" food, as it is similar to what would be eaten at home, with rice forming the basis of the meal, accompanied by various cooked dishes. Thus, there is no specific origin for the dish; instead it blends dishes and ingredients from the region they are cooked in. Economy rice stalls thus evolved as a way for the general public to obtain a quick, and most importantly, cheap meal option outside of home. An economy rice meal is usually one of the cheapest options available for a meal at a hawker centre (hence its name), especially if one is judicious in choosing the less expensive dishes (generally vegetables and tofu). Economy rice stalls are common features of [hawker centers](/wiki/Hawker_centre) or [kopitiams](/wiki/Kopi_tiam). ## Common dishes Common dishes offered at an economy rice stall can include sweet and sour pork, braised tofu, braised cabbage, steamed egg custard, stir-fried Chinese vegetables, fried eggs, and an assortment of deep-fried items. True to its Chinese origins, most of the dishes on offer tend to have their roots in Chinese cuisine. ## Other names Economy rice is known by several other names, and in general conversation it is rare for anyone to refer to it as such, even though many stalls tend to proclaim \"Economy rice\" on their signboards. Other names for economy rice include ***jaahp faahn*** ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 雜飯; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *zá fàn*; lit. 'mixed rice') in [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese_language) or ***tsa̍p-tshài-pn̄g*** ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 雜菜飯; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *zá cài fàn*; lit. 'mixed dishes (with) rice') in [Hokkien](/wiki/Singaporean_Hokkien) and, colloquially, \"point-point rice\", named for the method of ordering one's meal which involves simply asking for a plate of rice and then pointing at the various dishes desired, due to most people not knowing the Chinese names of the dishes. ## Similar cultures ### Malay-Indonesian [Nasi campur](/wiki/Nasi_campur), popular in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, is a mixed rice dish that shares similarities with economy rice. This dish represents the [Malay](/wiki/Malays_(ethnic_group)) and [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesians) interpretation of the concept. While economy rice typically features an array of Chinese-inspired dishes, such as stir-fried vegetables and braised meats, reflecting its Chinese culinary heritage, nasi campur emphasizes stronger [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine) and [Malay flavors](/wiki/Malay_cuisine), incorporating spices, [sambal](/wiki/Sambal) and distinct regional dishes like [rendang](/wiki/Rendang) and fried [tempeh](/wiki/Tempeh). The Indian Muslim community in Malaysia also has a similar concept called [nasi kandar](/wiki/Nasi_kandar), usually comprising rice and a variety of Indian-style curries. ### Thailand [Khao gaeng](/wiki/Khao_kaeng) ([Thai](/wiki/Thai_language): ข้าวแกง) is a popular [Thai meal of rice](/wiki/Thai_cuisine) served with a variety of pre-cooked dishes, including spicy curries, stir-fried meats, and vegetables, offering a broad selection that showcases Thai flavors and cooking styles. Known for its convenience and affordability, khao gaeng can be found in bustling markets, food courts and street-side vendors across [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand), catering to busy urban dwellers seeking quick, hearty meals. Establishments, known as raan khao gaeng ([Thai](/wiki/Thai_language): ร้านข้าวแกง), typically display an assortment of dishes in large trays, allowing customers to easily select portions for takeaway or dine-in. This traditional dining option has evolved with [Thai society](/wiki/Thai_people), becoming a daily staple for many due to its adaptability, rich flavors, and connection to Thai culinary heritage. ### Hong Kong In [Hong Kong](/wiki/Hong_Kong), there is a kind of similar dish known as \"**two-dish rice**\" ([Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 兩餸飯; [Jyutping](/wiki/Jyutping): *loeng5 sung3 faan6*), and its name may vary with the number of dishes included in a set. Some people also humorously call this kind of dish as “this this rice”, referring to way to order. Due to its low price, \"two-dish rice\" has gained increasing popularity, particularly among the grassroot citizens of Hong Kong during the economic recession brought by the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). Before the pandemic, this kind of dish has also been already popular in university and staff canteens. ### Hawaii [Plate lunch](/wiki/Plate_lunch) ([Hawaiian](/wiki/Hawaiian_language): *pā mea ʻai*) is a signature [Hawaiian meal](/wiki/Cuisine_of_Hawaii) that reflects a blend of [Polynesian](/wiki/Oceanian_cuisine), [North American](/wiki/North_American_cuisine) and [East Asian cuisines](/wiki/List_of_Asian_cuisines). Typically consisting of one or two scoops of white rice, [macaroni salad](/wiki/Macaroni_salad), and an entrée—often Japanese-inspired like [chicken katsu](/wiki/Chicken_katsu) or [teriyaki](/wiki/Teriyaki)—this meal has its roots in the 1880s, evolving from the Japanese [bento](/wiki/Bento) tradition to cater to plantation workers in Hawaii. Over time, it has expanded to include a variety of popular entrées, such as kalbi, [char siu](/wiki/Char_siu) pork, and [kālua puaʻa](/wiki/K%C4%81lua), showcasing the diverse culinary influences on the islands. As plate lunches gained popularity, they transitioned from lunch wagons to standalone restaurants, eventually making their way to the U.S. mainland, where they continue to attract fans of Hawaiian cuisine. ### Vietnam [Cơm bình dân](/wiki/C%C6%A1m_b%C3%ACnh_d%C3%A2n), or cơm bụi, is a [Vietnamese](/wiki/Vietnamese_language) term that refers to an affordable meal primarily featuring rice accompanied by a variety of side dishes typical of [Vietnamese cuisine](/wiki/Vietnamese_cuisine). Literally translating to \"commoner's rice,\" this dish is commonly sold by street vendors and restaurants. A typical cơm bình dân meal consists of a generous serving of rice, often paired with boiled or pickled vegetables, a light soup, and a selection of meats, which may include pork, beef, chicken, fish, or tofu, alongside grains and additional vegetables.\n",
