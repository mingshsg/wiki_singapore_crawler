The sculpture was moved to [Raffles Place Park](/wiki/Raffles_Place_Park) in 2013. ## Details The sculpture was sculpted with [stainless steel](/wiki/Stainless_steel) by Tan Wee Lit. The sculpture is of a toy kit, featuring several items, including a briefcase, a stroller and a bicycle, and is meant to represent the \"work-life balance that Singaporeans strive for\". The sculpture is intentionally left incomplete, to represent that \"people's vitality and aspirations are the most essential factors that make life complete\". ## Gallery This article about a Singapore building or structure is a stub.
