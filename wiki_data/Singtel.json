The fire started at around 2 p.m. Firemen from the [Singapore Civil Defence Force](/wiki/Singapore_Civil_Defence_Force) (SCDF) responded to the emergency call placed at 2.16pm and extinguished the fires in 20 minutes. After SCDF had cleared the building for access at 6pm, Singtel started repairing the damaged cable infrastructure. The repairs was initially assessed to be done by 10 October 2013, 7am with 33 cables of fibre strands requiring repairs. However, the repairs was slower than expected as it was difficult to identify the affected cables as visual indicators such as colour coding on the cables were rendered unusable and 116 other fibre cables required repairs as well. Connectivity to affected customers was progressively restored as the repairs stretched into the evening. The damage incurred extensive connectivity issues in the [North Western areas of Singapore](/wiki/North_West_Community_Development_Council), particularly in Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang, Bukit Timah, Choa Chu Kang, Kranji, Marsiling, Teck Whye and Woodlands. Singtel reported 100 mobile base stations were affected, disconnecting its mobile service subscribers in the area. It also reported that around 60,000 fixed broadband lines, 46,000 mioTV subscribers, and 30,000 voice lines were also affected. OpenNet also reported that 81 of its fibre cables were damaged, affecting 46,000 fibre connections downstream. Business such as [StarHub](/wiki/StarHub), [M1](/wiki/M1_Limited), [DBS](/wiki/DBS_Bank), OpenNet and [Singapore Pools](/wiki/Singapore_Pools) saw varying levels of disruptions to their services and operations islandwide. The cables were reconnected on 11 October 2013. However, there were still some subscribers whose connectivity services were still disrupted as of 16 October 2013. StarHub indicated that some of the repaired OpenNet cables, which it relied on to carry its fibre internet services, were not connected properly. Likewise, Singtel reported that several cables required further rectification works. Both offered alternate connectivity solutions to the affected subscribers as a temporary measure while further work took place, with StarHub sending cable modems to its affected subscribers to connect to its then existing coaxial cable network (which could carry Internet services, and was put to an end in June 2019), and Singtel sending mobile broadband dongles. Singtel also announced compensation packages to its affected subscribers of its various services. Singtel had set up a Board Committee of Inquiry (BCOI) to investigate the fire, with [Bobby Chin Yoke Choong](/wiki/Bobby_Chin_Yoke_Choong) as the chairman. Additionally, the BCOI would also benchmark current network design and contingency processes against international best practices and standards, and recommend appropriate improvements to prevent future occurrences and strengthen network resilience. Separately, IDA had launched an investigation into the fire as well. Questions were raised in the public on the infrastructure design of the telecommunications network. The fire exposed the fact that Bukit Panjang exchange was a single point of failure as connectivity services of 3 major ISPs were affected due to it, with the affected OpenNet fibre cables affecting a wide area across the nation. Preliminary findings realised by Singtel on 6 November 2013 indicated that the fire broke out during a maintenance work at one of the lead-in pipes located in the cable chamber. The fire was caused by an employee not following the maintenance procedures as well as the use of an unauthorised blowtorch. Maintenance protocols had since strengthened, limiting maintenance work which required heat to be applied and reinforcing training on safety requirements and operations. The BCOI report, dated 9 December 2013, was released on 17 December 2013. The report covered three main areas: fire prevention in exchanges, network reliability and resiliency, as well as public relations and communications. Singtel's board has accepted the BCOI's findings and would implement its recommendations. In Singtel's 2015 annual report, it was reported that the BCOI was satisfied that all the recommendations of the BCOI had been followed up and adequately addressed. Singtel was later fined $6 million Singapore dollars for the fire incident, it is the largest fine for a telco company in Singapore history. National fibre broadband network builder OpenNet and CityNet - the trustee manager of a Singtel unit that owns OpenNet - have also been fined $200,000 and $300,000, respectively, for failing to comply with safety procedures and restore services promptly. ### Gushcloud marketing scandal On 14 March 2015, [Xiaxue](/wiki/Xiaxue), a Singapore-based blogger, revealed on her blog instructions from [Gushcloud](/wiki/Gushcloud_International) to its network of bloggers to post complaints about the mobile services of Singtel's rivalling mobile service providers, [StarHub](/wiki/StarHub) and [M1](/wiki/M1_Limited), on social media, in a marketing effort to drive subscriptions of a new mobile service plan targeted at youths by Singtel. Along with her revelation, there were many samples of Gushcloud's bloggers taking up the offer and posting complaints up on social media services. Upon the release of the complaints, both Starhub and M1 called on IDA to investigate the matter. Initially denying that it had issued the brief, Singtel issued an apology, of which Starhub and M1 had accepted. Singtel also terminated its employee who had worked with Gushcloud on the campaign as the employee did not adhere to Singtel's professional standards and values. At the same time, Singtel ended its relationship with Gushcloud. Vincent Ha, Gushcloud's chief executive, released an apology through the firm on the firm's use of negative messaging and yet criticising Xiaxue's expose for \"doing more harm than good to our industry\". Xiaxue refuted the statement, saying he was trying to divert blame and calling Gushcloud's actions as \"not ethical\". Several bloggers involved issued apologies on their platforms as well. ### Data breach incident On 12 February 2020, Singtel was fined $9,000 Singapore dollars for a data breach incident involving the My Singtel mobile app, a smartphone application owned by Singtel. The incident began from Singtel encountering a technical issue during its migration to a new billing system in early 2018, resulting in the personal data of 750 mobile subscribers being exposed. Of these, 39 subscribers' personal data were in fact accessed by other subscribers over a period of about 11 hours. ### Assistant manager leaking client data and thieving Pleo Sherwin Cubos, an assistant manager, obtained illegal loan of [SGD](/wiki/Singapore_dollar)$500 from an unlicensed moneylender in January 2020. Due to the high interest rate, Cubos borrowed from other unlicensed moneylenders to repay the loan and his debt eventually snowballed to $3,000. He was later harassed by the moneylenders and one of the moneylender offered to stop his harassment if Cubos was to access Singtel's database to illegally obtained the phone numbers of several Singtel customers. Between 20 February 2020 to 25 April 2020, Cubos illegally accessed 27clients' data in the Singtel database and send the data of six clients to the moneylender. In March and April 2020, Cubos pawned three iPads that belong to Singtel for at least $250 Singapore dollars and spent the money on his personal expenses. Cubos' supervisor later discovered his offences and filed a police report on 2 May 2020. Cubos was then charged and pleaded guilty to one count each of assisting a loan shark and criminal breach of trust charge on 30 December 2020. He was sentenced to imprisonment for three months and three weeks and fined $30,000 Singapore dollars. ### Retail consultant selling client data Kelvin Foo Cheek Ann was a retail consultant at the Singtel outlet in Parkway Parade. Between 2014 and July 2017, he obtained Singtel's client data from Singtel's system without authorization and sold the data to his acquaintance, Lee Cheng Yan, as requested. Lee offered him $20 Singapore dollars for each mobile number checked on the system. All clients whose data sold were later received harassment calls, messages, and strangers appearing at their homes and demanding money. Foo took a total of $180 Singapore dollars of bribes from Lee. Foo pleaded guilty to one charge of corruption, five charges of unauthorized access to Singtel's system, and 10 charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. ### Zero-day attack On 11 February 2021, Singtel issued a statement admitting the company had been attacked by hackers in [Zero-day attack](/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)) which resulted in a data breach. Singtel CEO Yuen Kuan Moon issued a public apology regarding the incident, which was caused by a vulnerability in an [Accellion](/wiki/Accellion) file-sharing system used by Singtel. Accellion issued its first alert of the exploits in December 2020, Singtel then applied a series of patches provided by Accellion to resolve the vulnerability. On 23 January 2021, Accellion stated that a new vulnerability had emerged and patches previously applied in December 2020 are ineffective. Singtel immediately took its system offline since. Singtel's attempt to patch the new vulnerability in the FTA system on 30 January 2021 triggered an anomaly alert, and Accellion later informed that the system might have been breached. Singtel's investigations later confirmed the system was breached and identified 20 January 2021 as the occurrence day. Data stolen in the breach TypeAmountSingtel's customer's data, including NRIC, date of birth, name, contact number and address.129000 customersBank account info of former Singtel employees.28 employeesCredit card details of staff of a cooperate customers with Singtel mobile lines.45 staffsInformation of enterprises.23 enterprises ### Amobee executives plead guilty to hijacking IP addresses in order to send illegal spam On 10 June 2022, three employees of the affiliate marketing platform Amobee pleaded guilty in federal court to hijacking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to send unsolicited commercial email messages, commonly known as “spam.” ### Volt Typhoon attack In June 2024, Singtel was breached by China's [Volt Typhoon](/wiki/Volt_Typhoon) [advanced persistent threat](/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat).
