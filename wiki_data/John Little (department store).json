  "content": "Defunct chain of department stores in Singapore **John Little** was a former chain of [department stores](/wiki/Department_store) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). Established in 1845, John Little was the oldest department store in Singapore. The John Little chain was acquired and owned by [Robinson & Co. Limited](/wiki/Robinson_%26_Co._Limited) in 1955. ## History In 1842, John Martin Little worked for his uncle Francis S. Martin who started a retail business at Commercial Square (now [Raffles Place](/wiki/Raffles_Place)). In 1845, Francis S. Martin sold his business to Little and Cursetjee Frommurze to form **Little, Cursetjee & Co.**. Cursetjee Frommurze was a well-known [Parsee](/wiki/Parsee) [merchant](/wiki/Merchant). On 30 August 1845, Little and Frommurze started their business as [auctioneers](/wiki/Auctioneer) and [commission](/wiki/Commission_(remuneration)) [agents](/wiki/Agent_(law)), and offered services in [retail](/wiki/Retail) as well as [auction](/wiki/Auction) of [properties](/wiki/Property_rights_(economics)) such as [spice](/wiki/Spice) [plantations](/wiki/Plantation) and valuable household [furniture](/wiki/Furniture). [Shoppers](/wiki/Shopping) could buy [tickets](/wiki/Ticket_(admission)) to [plays](/wiki/Play_(theatre)), [musicals](/wiki/Musical_theatre) and other performances. Little, Cursetjee & Co. became a popular hangout for locals to hold meetings, and functioned like the modern-day equivalent of a central [box office](/wiki/Box_office). On 30 June 1853, Little and Frommurze ended their eight-year [partnership](/wiki/Partnership). Frommurze set up Cursetjee & Co. and hired Philip Robinson, who later founded Spicer & Robinson, which became [Robinsons](/wiki/Robinsons_%26_Co.). Little formed **John Little & Co.**, and John's brother, Matthew Little, was made a partner. The business continued in the same direction and premises. In January 1894, John Little & Co. Ltd was registered in [London](/wiki/London) by Harwood and Stephenson, with a [capital](/wiki/Capital_(economics)) of [£](/wiki/Pound_sterling)75,000 in £20 [shares](/wiki/Share_(finance)). As Singapore grew as a [trading](/wiki/Trade) [port](/wiki/Port) in the late 19th century, John Little expanded in the same period. In addition to retail, John Little also operated a [car](/wiki/Car) business, a motor [garage](/wiki/Automobile_repair_shop), a [furniture](/wiki/Furniture) factory, a [café](/wiki/Caf%C3%A9) and a [beauty salon](/wiki/Beauty_salon). From its original one-storey premises in Raffles Place, the store expanded to occupy another floor. In the early 20th century, John Little also set up branches in [Malaya](/wiki/British_Malaya); there were branches in [Kuala Lumpur](/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur) (1914, near today's [Market Square](/wiki/Medan_Pasar_bus_hub) and [Masjid Jamek](/wiki/Masjid_Jamek_LRT_station)), [Penang](/wiki/Penang) (1926), and [Ipoh](/wiki/Ipoh) (1929). However, the advent of [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II) and subsequent [Japanese Occupation](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Malaya) resulted in the closure of these branches. After the [Japanese occupation of Singapore](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore) ended in 1945, it took some time for John Little to re-open for business due to lack of [manpower](/wiki/Human_resources) and [merchandise](/wiki/Merchandise). In June 1946, John Little resumed business, and subsequently registered such good sales that the store declared a 20% [dividend](/wiki/Dividend) for its ordinary [shareholders](/wiki/Shareholder) in 1948. In 1955, John Little was acquired by Robinsons. The store was relaunched as *JL* on 29 August 1987 with a new [logo](/wiki/Logo), new image and [merchandise](/wiki/Merchandise) selection. Its main store moved from Raffles Place to several locations before moving into Specialists' Shopping Centre until its closure in July 2007. ## Closure of stores In 2015, Al-Futtaim, the owner of Robinsons, announced that JL's Marina Square & Tiong Bahru Plaza store will be closed due to lack of businesses and renovation. The Marina Square store closed on 26 April, while Tiong Bahru Plaza also closed in August 2015. John Little will also close Jurong Point outlet in August 2016 for the transfer to BHG. By the end of 2016, its last store in Plaza Singapura will also be closed. The chain's last store in [Plaza Singapura](/wiki/Plaza_Singapura) was closed in the end of 2016. The former stores included: - [Marina Square](/wiki/Marina_Square) store: John Little's largest outlet which opened in June 2007 and closed on 26 April 2015 (Closed due to building's renovation works); - [White Sands](/wiki/White_Sands_Shopping_Mall,_Singapore) store: White Sands store closed in July 2007 - [Tiong Bahru Plaza](/wiki/Tiong_Bahru_Plaza) store: Tiong Bahru Plaza store closed in August 2015 (Closed due to building's renovation works and poor business) - [Jurong Point](/wiki/Jurong_Point_Shopping_Mall) store: Jurong Point store to be replaced by BHG in August 2016 - Main store at [Specialists' Shopping Centre](/wiki/Specialists%27_Shopping_Centre) along Orchard Road closed on 9 July 2007. - [Plaza Singapura](/wiki/Plaza_Singapura) store: Plaza Singapura store closed 2 January 2017, replaced by Muji Flagship. ## Pop-up retail store In 2016, the Robinsons company announced that they would be changing the John Little brand to a [pop up store](/wiki/Pop-up_retail). ## Notes and references\n",
