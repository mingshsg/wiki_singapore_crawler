  "content": "Corridor of the Belt and Road Initiative The **China-Indochina Peninsula economic corridor** (CICPEC) is an [economic corridor](/wiki/Economic_corridor) initiated in 2010 and incorporated later into the [Belt and Road Initiative](/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative). It was known before as the Nanning-Singapore Economic Corridor. The economic corridor connects several cities in Southern [China](/wiki/China) with the major cities of [Southeast Asia](/wiki/ASEAN) including [Hanoi](/wiki/Hanoi) in [Vietnam](/wiki/Vietnam), [Vientiane](/wiki/Vientiane) in [Laos](/wiki/Laos), [Phnom Penh](/wiki/Phnom_Penh) in [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia), [Bangkok](/wiki/Bangkok) in [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand), [Kuala Lumpur](/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur) in [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) with modern road, rail, and pipelines. The corridor is planned to better connect neighbouring economies, and encourage development across the [ASEAN–China Free Trade Area](/wiki/ASEAN%E2%80%93China_Free_Trade_Area). ## Development One of the first steps is the [Nanning–Pingxiang high-speed line](/wiki/Nanning%E2%80%93Pingxiang_high-speed_line), a railway in [Guangxi](/wiki/Guangxi) province in southern China, which would form the northern end of the corridor. A 5000 km Nanning-Singapore railway is planned.\n",
