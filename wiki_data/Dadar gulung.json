  "content": "Indonesian coconut pancake ***Dadar gulung*** (lit. 'rolled pancake/omelette\"') is a popular traditional *[kue](/wiki/Kue)* (traditional snack) of sweet [coconut](/wiki/Coconut) [pancake](/wiki/Pancake). It is often described as an Indonesian coconut pancake. *Dadar gulung* is one of the popular snacks in [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine), especially in [Java](/wiki/Java). In [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_language), *dadar* literally means \"omelette\" or \"pancake\" while *gulung* means \"to roll\". The pancake usually has a green colour, which is acquired from *daun suji* or pandan leaves. It is a green-coloured folded [omelette](/wiki/Omelette) or pancake made of [rice flour](/wiki/Rice_flour), filled with grated coconut and [palm sugar](/wiki/Palm_sugar). It is commonly found in Indonesia, [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei). The snack is commonly found in traditional marketplaces and *[Warung](/wiki/Warung)* in Indonesia, especially in Java, [Bali](/wiki/Bali) and other regions. In [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysian_cuisine) and [Brunei](/wiki/Bruneian_cuisine), it is known as **kuih gulung**, **kuih ketayap** and **kuih lenggang**. In [Sri Lanka](/wiki/Sri_Lanka) it is known as **surul appam**. Similar to Indonesia, in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) it is known as **kuih dadar**. ## Ingredients and cooking method The [batter](/wiki/Batter_(cooking)) is made from the mixture of [flour](/wiki/Flour), [salt](/wiki/Salt), [eggs](/wiki/Egg_(food)) and [coconut milk](/wiki/Coconut_milk). Mix the batter with *suji* or [daun pandan](/wiki/Pandanus_amaryllifolius) paste as green food colouring. To make the filling, combine the grated coconut flesh, [palm sugar](/wiki/Palm_sugar), salt, [cinnamon](/wiki/Cinnamon) and water in a pot on the stove. A tied pandan leaf is usually added to the mixture for aroma. The green-coloured batter is then cooked on a flat frying pan with a small amount of margarine, much in the same fashion as baking a thin pancake or omelette. Afterwards, the sweet coconut filling is placed upon the flat green pancake, and then folded on each side just like a [tortilla](/wiki/Tortilla), to create an elongated rectangular shape.[*citation needed*] - Food portal - Indonesia portal - [Daral](/wiki/Daral_(food)) - [Klepon](/wiki/Klepon) - [Kue putu](/wiki/Kue_putu) - [List of pancakes](/wiki/List_of_pancakes) - [Semar mendem](/wiki/Semar_mendem) - RECIPE: Dadar Gulung (Indonesian Coconut Pancakes) - How to make dadar gulung video\n",
