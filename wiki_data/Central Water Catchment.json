The country's main reservoirs—[MacRitchie](/wiki/MacRitchie_Reservoir), [Upper Seletar](/wiki/Upper_Seletar_Reservoir), [Upper Peirce](/wiki/Upper_Peirce_Reservoir), and [Lower Peirce](/wiki/Lower_Peirce_Reservoir)—are in the central catchment area. The Central Water Catchment lies in the geographical centre of the city and is largely home to the [Central Catchment Nature Reserve](/wiki/Central_Catchment_Nature_Reserve), which houses several other recreational sites, including the [Singapore Zoo](/wiki/Singapore_Zoo), the [Night Safari](/wiki/Night_Safari,_Singapore), and the [River Safari](/wiki/River_Safari). ## Wildlife MacRitchie Reservoir has resident animals such as [birds](/wiki/List_of_birds_of_Singapore), monkeys, and [monitor lizards](/wiki/Monitor_lizard). The [Treetop Walk](/wiki/Central_Catchment_Nature_Reserve#HSBC_TreeTop_Walk), a one-way suspension bridge, is a popular attraction for birdwatchers and tourists.[*citation needed*] The monkeys at MacRitchie Reservoir are infamous for attacking people out of aggression and in search of food. These attacks have occasionally led to injuries among visitors. The National Parks Board has put up signs all over the reservoir, instructing people on what to do when they encounter monkeys.[*citation needed*] Birds such as the [white-bellied sea eagle](/wiki/White-bellied_sea_eagle) can be found in the Upper Seletar Reservoir.\n",
