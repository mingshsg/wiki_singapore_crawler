This subzone comprises businesses, educational institutions, residential developments and civic and community institutions. ## History Place in Singapore Prior to the 1990s, the subzone was part of the **Bulim estate** (a [Slum](/wiki/Slum)) and where the **Bulim Hill Cemetery** (a Chinese cemetery) was located. In 1984, the cemetery was closed and exhumed thereafter to make way for the [Kranji](/wiki/Kranji_Expressway) and [Pan Island](/wiki/Pan_Island_Expressway) expressways. This segregated the Bulim estate and its western section became a subzone of Jurong West and was given the name **Wenya**. In the 1990s, the development of Wenya began. Originally designed to be a residential subzone, the first two housing estates were completed in 2000 and 2002 respectively, complemented with the re-location of Corporation Primary and [Westwood Secondary](/wiki/Westwood_Secondary_School) schools to the area in 2001, and the building of associated facilities for living. In 2005, the [Housing and Development Board](/wiki/Housing_and_Development_Board) released two land parcels in the subzone for interim uses . In 2007, the subzone was however re-zoned to be an Industrial area and the eastern section (occupying majority of the subzone) carved out and re-designed as **Wenya Industrial Park**. In 2012, a study was conducted to assess a new road network at the subzone for the industrial development. This led to the construction of **Wenya Avenue** and **Wenya Street** in 2013. In 2014, the names of Wenya Avenue and Wenya Street were changed to **Bulim Avenue** and **Bulim Street** respectively. ## Economy ### Bulim Industrial Park Situated east of the existing residential developments in the subzone, this is an Industrial zone that has been steadily developing since 2012. It will be part of the **2 West** Integrated industrial township, which includes the neighboring [NTU](/wiki/Nanyang_Technological_University), [CleanTech Park](/wiki/CleanTech_Park) and a section of [Tengah](/wiki/Tengah,_Singapore). With the completion of a data centre and a corporate headquarters in the zone, the first section of the Industrial Park is set to open in 2014, followed by the opening of the second section in 2015, when a new [bus depot](/wiki/Bus_station), to be operated by [Tower Transit Singapore](/wiki/Tower_Transit_Singapore), is ready. #### Interim uses Along Jurong West Street 25, there are 2 interim developments, namely a Nursery(**Thong Hup Gardens**) and a Sports Ground for Futsal(**Golazo Futsal Singapore**). ### Commercial At the ground floor of Block 276 (a [multi-storey car park](/wiki/Multi-storey_car_park)), there is an Eating House, Clinic, Salon, Betting kiosk, Food & Beverages-cum-Launderette shop, and 3 Provision Shops, as well as an [automated teller machine](/wiki/Automated_teller_machine) (ATM). ### Industrial Along Bulim Avenue and Bulim Street, developments for a Logistics Park has been ongoing since 2013. Currently, there are 3 businesses that are currently operating at Bulim, namely Google, Kintetsu World Express (KWE) and recently LF Logistics. Constructions for two more industrial buildings are currently ongoing along Bulim Avenue. This location for a Logistics Park makes strategic sense, as it is near the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE), Kranji-Expressway (KJE), access to labour market with flats nearby, and connections to Boon Lay Bus Interchange via feeder bus service along Jurong West Street 25 and 23. ## Transport **Wenya** is linked to the [PIE Expressway](/wiki/Pan_Island_Expressway) with [Major Arterial Roads](/wiki/Arterial_road) Jurong West Avenue 2 (from [Changi](/wiki/Changi)) and Jalan Bahar (from [Tuas](/wiki/Tuas) and [KJE Expressway](/wiki/Kranji_Expressway)), and to the [AYE](/wiki/Ayer_Rajah_Expressway) with Jalan Bahar (via Jalan Boon Lay).
