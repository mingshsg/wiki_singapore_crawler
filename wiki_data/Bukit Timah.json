  "content": "Area in Central Region, SingaporePlanning Area and HDB Estate in Central Region, Singapore **Bukit Timah** ([IPA](/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): /ˈbʊkɪt ˌtiːmɑː/ *BUUK-it TEE-mah*), often abbreviated as **Bt Timah**, is a [planning area](/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore) and [residential estate](/wiki/New_towns_of_Singapore) located in the westernmost part of the [Central Region](/wiki/Central_Region,_Singapore) of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). Bukit Timah lies roughly 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the [Central Business District](/wiki/Downtown_Core), bordering the [Central Water Catchment](/wiki/Central_Water_Catchment) to the north, [Bukit Panjang](/wiki/Bukit_Panjang) to the northwest, [Queenstown](/wiki/Queenstown,_Singapore) to the south, [Tanglin](/wiki/Tanglin) to the southeast, [Clementi](/wiki/Clementi,_Singapore) to the southwest, [Novena](/wiki/Novena,_Singapore) to the east and [Bukit Batok](/wiki/Bukit_Batok) to the west. It is further split into eight subzones, namely Anak Bukit, Coronation Road, Farrer Court, Hillcrest, [Holland Road](/wiki/Holland_Road,_Singapore), Leedon Park, Swiss Club and Ulu Pandan. Owing to its prime location, Bukit Timah has one of the densest clusters of luxury condominiums and landed property in Singapore, with little public housing. ## Etymology The last identification of the area was on the 1828 map by Frankin and [Jackson](/wiki/Philip_Jackson_(surveyor)) and was noted as Bukit Timah. As the interior of Singapore was not fully explored, it is likely the name came from the [Malays](/wiki/Malays_(ethnic_group)). In [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language), Bukit Timah meant *Tin bearing hill*. The original Malay name was *Bukit Temak*, meaning \"hill of the [temak trees](/wiki/Shorea_curtisii)\" as the temak trees were abundant in the area. It was possible that the British in Singapore had mispronounced or misheard and became Bukit Timah. ## History [Bukit Timah Road](/wiki/Bukit_Timah_Road), was completed in 1843 to provide a link to the highest point of Singapore, the [Bukit Timah Hill](/wiki/Bukit_Timah_Hill). The road was then extended northwards to Kranji in 1845, making it one of the earliest roads connecting the north to the south. The [Bukit Timah railway station](/wiki/Bukit_Timah_railway_station) (BRTS) was one of the five Singapore-Kranji railway stations opened in 1905, the first railway of Singapore. BRTS was decommissioned in July 2011 together with [Tanjong Pagar railway station](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar_railway_station). Sections of the former railway station have been repurposed as a community space, and is now part of the [Rail Corridor](/wiki/Rail_Corridor_(Singapore)). Bukit Timah was a major battleground during the final stages of the [Japanese Invasion](/wiki/Fall_of_Singapore) in 1942, where the [Battle of Bukit Timah](/wiki/Battle_of_Bukit_Timah) was fought. The battle resulted in the fall of Bukit Timah to the Japanese as British had failed to repel the invaders from the area. Beauty World was formerly named *Tai Tong Ah Sai Ka*i which was founded as an amusement park during the Japanese Occupation. Following the end of occupation, Tai Tong Ah Sai Kai was renamed *Beauty World* in 1947 and reopened as a market. After being badly damaged by series of fires in the 1970s, Beauty World was acquired by the government and was redeveloped as a shopping centre, which opened in 1984. ## Infrastructure The Bukit Timah area is a particularly prominent location with high land value. The [Bukit Timah Race Course](/wiki/Bukit_Timah_Race_Course), a [thoroughbred](/wiki/Thoroughbred) [horse racing](/wiki/Horse_racing) facility, was opened in 1933 and operated until 1999. The land has since been renovated, and is currently home to The Grandstand, which hosts several food outlets, childcare services and a Giant supermarket. The nearby area hosts many [bungalows](/wiki/Bungalow#Singapore_and_Malaysia), typically expensive in land-scarce Singapore, as well as high rise [condominiums](/wiki/Condominium_(living_space)). Many [expatriates](/wiki/Expatriate) and well-heeled Singaporeans live in this region. Its main attractions include popular eateries at Sixth Avenue, as well as Turf City. This region was later extended and Upper Bukit Timah (District 21) was formed. ### Mass Rapid Transit There are 7 [MRT](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) stations within the planning area, spanning 2 lines, the [Downtown Line](/wiki/Downtown_Line) and [Circle Line](/wiki/Circle_Line_(Singapore)), namely: - **DT5** [Beauty World](/wiki/Beauty_World_MRT_station) - **DT6** [King Albert Park](/wiki/King_Albert_Park_MRT_station) - **DT7** [Sixth Avenue](/wiki/Sixth_Avenue_MRT_station) - **DT8** [Tan Kah Kee](/wiki/Tan_Kah_Kee_MRT_station) - **CC19** **DT9** [Botanic Gardens](/wiki/Botanic_Gardens_MRT_station) - **CC20** [Farrer Road](/wiki/Farrer_Road_MRT_station) - **CC21** [Holland Village](/wiki/Holland_Village_MRT_station) Stage 2 of the [Downtown MRT line](/wiki/Downtown_Line) train service started on 27 December 2015 and parallels the Bukit Timah Road. It connects Bukit Panjang in the North-Western edge of Bukit Timah to the city centre in the South. Both lines have an interchange station at [Botanic Gardens MRT station](/wiki/Botanic_Gardens_MRT_station). Rail expansion is ongoing in Bukit Timah, with three new MRT stations slated to open in 2032 as part of the [Cross Island MRT line](/wiki/Cross_Island_Line). The upcoming MRT stations are: - **CR14** [Turf City](/wiki/Turf_City_MRT_station) - **CR15** [King Albert Park](/wiki/King_Albert_Park_MRT_station) - **CR16** [Maju](/wiki/Maju_MRT_station) ## Education Bukit Timah is known to having many international schools in the region, due to the high number of expatriates and immigrants living in this region. ### Primary schools - Bukit Timah Primary School - Henry Park Primary School - [Methodist Girls' School (Primary)](/wiki/Methodist_Girls%27_School,_Singapore) - Nanyang Primary School - Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School - Raffles Girls' Primary School ### Secondary schools - [Anglo Chinese School](/wiki/Anglo_Chinese_School)* - [St Joseph's Institution](/wiki/St_Joseph%27s_Institution) - [Singapore Chinese Girls School](/wiki/Singapore_Chinese_Girls_School)* - [Hwa Chong Institution](/wiki/Hwa_Chong_Institution) - [Methodist Girls' School (Secondary)](/wiki/Methodist_Girls%27_School,_Singapore) - [Nanyang Girls' High School](/wiki/Nanyang_Girls%27_High_School) - [National Junior College](/wiki/National_Junior_College) - [St. Margaret's Secondary School](/wiki/St._Margaret%27s_Secondary_School) ### Tertiary institutions - [Hwa Chong Institution](/wiki/Hwa_Chong_Institution) - [National Junior College](/wiki/National_Junior_College) - [St Joseph's Institution](/wiki/St_Joseph%27s_Institution) - [Ngee Ann Polytechnic](/wiki/Ngee_Ann_Polytechnic) - [Singapore Institute of Management](/wiki/Singapore_Institute_of_Management) - [Singapore University of Social Sciences](/wiki/Singapore_University_of_Social_Sciences) ### Other schools - [Chatsworth International School](/wiki/Chatsworth_International_School) - DIMENSIONS International College (Bukit Timah Campus) - Holland International School - [Hwa Chong International School](/wiki/Hwa_Chong_International_School) - St Francis Methodist School - [Singapore Korean International School](/wiki/Singapore_Korean_International_School) - [Swiss School in Singapore](/wiki/Swiss_School_in_Singapore) ## Notable locations - [Lana Cake Shop](/wiki/Lana_Cake_Shop), cake shop - [Bukit Timah Monkey Man](/wiki/Bukit_Timah_Monkey_Man) – cryptid said to be living in the Bukit Timah forest ## Sources - National Heritage Board (2002), *Singapore's 100 Historic Places*, Archipelago Press, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-4068-23-3\n",
