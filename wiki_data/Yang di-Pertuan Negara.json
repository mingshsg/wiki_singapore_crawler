Under a transitional arrangement, the last Governor of Singapore, Sir [William Goode](/wiki/William_Goode_(colonial_administrator)), served as the first Yang di-Pertuan Negara from 3 June to 3 December 1959. He was succeeded by [Yusof Ishak](/wiki/Yusof_Ishak), who was sworn into office on the same day as the country's [state flag](/wiki/Flag_of_Singapore), [coat of arms](/wiki/Coat_of_Arms_of_Singapore), and [national anthem](/wiki/Majulah_Singapura) were adopted. Initially, the office bearer was sometimes referred to as \"Head of State\". This was despite him constitutionally only a *[de facto](/wiki/De_facto)*, not *[de jure](/wiki/De_jure)*, [head of state](/wiki/Head_of_state), acting as a [vice-regal](/wiki/Vice-regal) representative in lieu of a typical [Governor-General](/wiki/Governor-General). The title was retained on 31 August 1963 when Singapore declared independence from the United Kingdom and acceded to Malaysia as a [state](/wiki/Singapore_in_Malaysia) on 16 September 1963. The officeholder then acted as the vice-regal representative of the [Yang di-Pertuan Agong](/wiki/Yang_di-Pertuan_Agong) of [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia)., appointed by him at his own discretion, after the consultation the Prime Minister of Singapore. On 9 August 1965, Singapore was separated from the federation to become an independent state within the [Commonwealth of Nations](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations). On 22 December of that year, the Constitution was amended to make the country a republic, and the title of Yang di-Pertuan Negara was changed to [President](/wiki/President_of_Singapore) with retroactive effect from the date of independence. ### List of officeholders **№**PortraitName (Born–Died)Term of OfficeOriginBackground or Previous AppointmentMonarchRefTook officeLeft officeDuration1Sir [William Goode](/wiki/William_Goode_(colonial_administrator)) (1907–1986)3 June 19592 December 19595 monthsMiddlesex, EnglandChief Secretary of Singapore, Governor of Singapore **[Elizabeth II](/wiki/Elizabeth_II)** 2[Yusof Ishak](/wiki/Yusof_Ishak) (1910–1970)3 December 19599 August 19655 years, 9 monthsTaiping, PerakChairman of the Public Service Commission of Singapore **[Elizabeth II](/wiki/Elizabeth_II)** (Until 15 September 1963) **[Putra of Perlis](/wiki/Putra_of_Perlis)** (From 16 September 1963) ## Brunei In [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei), the [Sultan of Brunei](/wiki/Sultan_of_Brunei) is also known as the *Yang Di-Pertuan Negara Brunei Darussalam*.
