  "content": "* *Pig fallopian tubes** ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 生肠; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *shēng cháng*; [Cantonese](/wiki/Cantonese): *sang cheong*) is a traditional, [Malaysian](/wiki/Malaysia) [stir-fry](/wiki/Stir-fry) dish. ## Preparation and description The dish is prepared by stir-frying [fallopian tubes](/wiki/Fallopian_tubes) (sometimes the [uterus](/wiki/Uterus)) of pigs and serving chopped with vegetables and sauce such as [Kung Pao](/wiki/Kung_Pao) sauce or [soy sauce](/wiki/Soy_sauce) with ginger and onions; the meat is relatively flavorless but is a good vehicle for the sauce. Other protein sources such as dried [shrimp](/wiki/Shrimp) may be added. The texture of the meat has been described as combining crunch with springiness. Although traditional, the dish is not often served in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). ## Cultural impact Consumption of pig fallopian tubes is said to have a beneficial effect on women's fertility. The dish is sometimes imprecisely referred to as [pig intestine](/wiki/Chitterlings).\n",
