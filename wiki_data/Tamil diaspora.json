They are found primarily in [Malaysia](/wiki/Tamil_Malaysians), [Arab states of the Persian Gulf](/wiki/Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf), [South Africa](/wiki/Tamil_South_Africans), [North America](/wiki/North_America), [Western Europe](/wiki/Western_Europe), and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore_Tamils). It can be divided into two main diasporic clusters, due to geographical, historical and cultural reasons, as [Indian Tamil diaspora](/wiki/Indian_Tamil_diaspora) and [Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamil_diaspora). Four groups make up the bulk of the Tamil diaspora: colonial-era descendants of migrants to [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia), South Africa, [East Africa](/wiki/East_Africa), the [Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean), and [Fiji](/wiki/Fiji); recent, educated Tamil immigrants primarily to the [U.S.](/wiki/United_States), [Australia](/wiki/Australia), and the [U.K.](/wiki/United_Kingdom); [Sri Lankan Tamil](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamil) refugees who resettled primarily in [Canada](/wiki/Canada), Western and [Northern Europe](/wiki/Northern_Europe), and [Oceania](/wiki/Oceania) between the 1980s and 2010s; and recent Tamil migration to the Gulf states of the Middle East as labor. ## Early migrations Tamils have a long tradition of seafaring and a history of overseas migration to foreign lands due to close proximity to the [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean) throughout ancient and medieval times. Many of the Tamil [emigrants](/wiki/Emigrants) who left the shores of Tamil Nadu before the 18th century mixed with other ethnicities in other regions. In the medieval period Tamils emigrated as soldiers, traders and laborers settled in [Kerala](/wiki/Kerala) (specially [Palakkad](/wiki/Palakkad)), [Karnataka](/wiki/Karnataka), [Maharashtra](/wiki/Maharashtra), Sri Lanka, [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia) and intermixed well with the local population, while few communities still maintain their language and culture. Many groups still claim descent from medieval-era Tamil emigrants such as the [Thigalas](/wiki/Thigala), [Hebbars](/wiki/Hebbar) of Karnataka who have resided in Karnataka for generations and even adopted Kannada as their mother tongue, [Palakkad Iyers](/wiki/Palakkad_Iyers) of Kerala, [Kaikadis](/wiki/Kaikadi_people) of Maharashtra, [Chittys](/wiki/Chitty) of [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and some section of the [Sri Lankan](/wiki/Sri_Lanka) [Tamils](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils) and [Sinhaleses](/wiki/Sinhalese_people) such as the [Sri Lankan Chetties](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Chetties), the [Bharatha people](/wiki/Bharatha_people), the [Karavas](/wiki/Karava), the [Duravas](/wiki/Durava), the [Demala Gattaras](/wiki/Demala_Gattara) and the [Salagamas](/wiki/Salagama).[*citation needed*] An early emigrant group that is not well documented is the [Tamil Muslims](/wiki/Tamil_Muslim) who emigrated in considerable numbers to the [Sultanate of Malacca](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Malacca) (in present-day [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia)) and were instrumental in spreading Islam amongst the indigenous [Malays](/wiki/Malays_people). Some are descended from immigrants from [Arabia (Middle East)](/wiki/The_Middle_East), though it is not known which part of the Arab world they were from.[*citation needed*] ## British, French, and Dutch indentured workers and others During this period the British, Dutch, French, Portuguese and Danish colony administrators recruited many local Tamils and took them to their overseas colonies to work as laborers, petty administration officers, and in clerical and military duties. In the 19th century, the Tamil region of the Madras Presidency was affected by severe famines, such as the [Great Famine of 1876–78](/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1876%E2%80%9378), and as such the region was both politically and economically weak. The British thus made use of hungry Tamil workers for their plantations all over the world - Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar, Mauritius, [South Africa](/wiki/Tamil_South_Africans), [Kenya](/wiki/Indians_in_Kenya), [Tanzania](/wiki/Indians_in_Tanzania), Fiji and also Sri Lanka (unrelated to Tamils who migrated to [Sri Lanka](/wiki/Indian_Tamils_of_Sri_Lanka) before the 18th century). Some of the Tamil groups (especially the Chettiyars, Pillais, Muslims) emigrated as commercial migrants. They then dominated the trade and finance in Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, South Africa, [Kenya](/wiki/Indians_in_Kenya), [Tanzania](/wiki/Indians_in_Tanzania) and other places. The first Indian to own a merchant ship during the British times comes from this group. These Tamilians integrated and assimilated well with their adopted countries, and became well integrated into local populations in [Mauritius](/wiki/Mauritius), South Africa, [Guyana](/wiki/Guyana), and [Fiji](/wiki/Fiji). On the other hand, [Karnataka Tamils](/wiki/Tamils_in_Bangalore) of Karnataka, [Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka](/wiki/Indian_Tamils_of_Sri_Lanka) of Sri Lanka, and [Tamil Malaysians](/wiki/Tamil_Malaysians) of Malaysia were evolved into distinct communities of their own with unique multilingual sub-culture and identity. Many also left to work in the possessions of the [French Empire](/wiki/French_colonial_empire) via its holdings in [Pondichéry](/wiki/Pondicherry_district) in [Réunion](/wiki/R%C3%A9union) and the French Caribbean islands of [Martinique](/wiki/Martinique) and [Guadeloupe](/wiki/Guadeloupe) (see [Malabars](/wiki/Malabars)). A small group was hired by the [Dutch](/wiki/Netherlands) colonial government in the [Dutch East Indies](/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies) (present-day Indonesia) to work in [Sumatra](/wiki/Sumatra) (namely in [Medan](/wiki/Medan)). Roughly about 40,000 (est.) descendants of these immigrants are still found in [Medan](/wiki/Medan). Many independent Tamil merchant guilds, such as the [Nagarathar](/wiki/Nagarathar), also left for these areas in an age-old tradition of their ancestors who had traded in these areas for the last 2,000 years. Britain also hired many Sri Lankan Tamils as clerical and other white-collar workers, especially in Malaysia and Singapore. All these different streams have combined to create vibrant Tamil communities in these countries. Also, many [Tamils](/wiki/Tamil_people) from India and Sri Lanka migrated to the [Crown colony of Singapore](/wiki/Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements) and [British Malaya](/wiki/British_Malaya) as laborers, army clerks and merchants. ## Twentieth century ### Return migration from Sri Lanka and Burma During and after the devastation of [WW2](/wiki/World_War_II), many Tamils and other Indians from Burma fled to India to [Manipur](/wiki/Manipur), and Tamil Nadu. They established Burmese refugee colonies that still exist today and maintain an identity as Burmese returnees. In Sri Lanka the [Sinhalese](/wiki/Sinhalese_people) nationalist [SLFP](/wiki/SLFP) party disfranchised all Indian origin [Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka](/wiki/Indian_Tamils_of_Sri_Lanka) and returned 600,000 back to India under the [Srimavo-Shastri Pact](/wiki/Srimavo-Shastri_Pact) signed between India and Sri Lanka. Many were repatriated to the [Nilgiris](/wiki/Nilgiris_(mountains)) region's tea estates. They too maintain a distinct identity as [Ceylon](/wiki/Ceylon) returnees in Tamil Nadu. [Black July](/wiki/Black_July) has created another stream of Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka refugees in India who have languished for the last 20 years in refugee camps throughout Tamil Nadu while many others have integrated with the mainstream community or left India for other countries in the west. There is also a movement of native Sri Lankan Tamils to India; some migrated to do white-collar jobs during the British days, but there has been a much bigger diaspora today. ### Post-1983 dispersal of Sri Lankan Tamils The [Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamil_diaspora) was well established in Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom prior to the 1983 [Black July](/wiki/Black_July) induced dispersal of refugees and asylum claimants in India, [Europe](/wiki/Europe), and [Canada](/wiki/Canada). Although relatively recent in origin, this subgroup had well-established communities in these host countries prior to the 1983 [pogroms](/wiki/Pogroms). ### 20th century dispersal of Tamils from India In the second half of the 20th century, Tamils from India migrated as skilled professionals to various parts of India and countries like UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UK, USA, Singapore and so on. Some of them got citizenship of respective countries but still having strong family and cultural ties with Tamil Nadu, than those who migrated before 1950, who lost touch with their ancestral links in Tamil Nadu. ## By region ### Africa #### Mainland Africa There is a significant number of Tamils in Africa, especially Kenya. At least 30% of the Tamils in Africa live in Kenya, followed by Uganda. Most of these people are migrants, while some have been living there for generations. #### South Africa Tamil migration to [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa) started as from 1860, first as indentured labor and in the first batch 340 Tamils were there. Now there are more than 250,000 Tamils spread over in many cities, the concentration being in [Natal](/wiki/Natal_(region)) and [Durban](/wiki/Durban). In South Africa the Tamil Language can be taken in many schools as a Second Additional Language, It is recognised as a level 4 subject and carries points for entrance into university. #### Indian Ocean islands #### Mauritius [Mauritius](/wiki/Mauritius) has a Tamil population of 80,000. Most arrived from Tamil Nadu after 1835, shortly after slavery was abolished, to replace the freed African and malgache slaves, to serve as indentured laborers on the sugar cane plantations. Tamil culture has flourished in Mauritius. Since 1835, the Tamil community has built almost 125 Tamil temples and [Murugan](/wiki/Murugan) is a popular deity. Tamil holidays and festivals such as [Tamil New Year](/wiki/Tamil_New_Year) Varusha Pirapu, [Pongal](/wiki/Pongal_(festival)), [Timiti](/wiki/Timiti) and [Thaipusam](/wiki/Thaipusam) are celebrated on a national level. [Thiruvalluvar](/wiki/Thiruvalluvar) and Bharathi days are also celebrated while [Deepavali](/wiki/Deepavali), Thaipusam, [Maha Shivaratri](/wiki/Maha_Shivaratri) and Pongal are public holidays. But most of the people in Mauritius do not speak Tamil. The Tamil language is taught in approximately 100 primary schools. Tamil language and literature can be studied at university level to obtain B.A. and M.A. degrees. The Mahatma Gandhi Institute promotes the Indian languages which are present in Mauritius. Tamils are attempting to include their religion and other Hindu practices. Once Tamil priests came from Jaffna in [Sri Lanka](/wiki/Sri_Lanka), they conducted prayers in Tamil. Later, some scholars started to facilitate the population to get access to sacred books. This helped the people to learn Tamil holy Enchantment from [Thevarams](/wiki/Thevaram) and [Thiruvasagam](/wiki/Thiruvasagam) #### Réunion Tamil settlement in the French department of [Réunion](/wiki/R%C3%A9union) started as far back as 1848 as indentured labor, mainly from [Pondichéry](/wiki/Pondicherry_district) and [Karaikal](/wiki/Karaikal), the French territories in Southern India. There are now about 126,000 Tamils living in Réunion or \"Malabars\" as they are known there with many Hindu temples run by voluntary organisations where Hindu and Tamil cultural links are preserved well. #### Seychelles Tamil traders from [Pondicherry](/wiki/Pondicherry_(city)) used to visit the [Seychelles](/wiki/Seychelles) for purposes of timber trade followed by settlements of Tamils from Tamil Nadu for trading purposes. Later, a trading community was in place here mainly of Tamils and many of them got integrated with the local community. Now there about 4000 Tamils in the trading business as well as in other professions. ### Americas #### North America #### Canada As per the [2021 Canadian census](/wiki/2021_Canadian_census), Tamil Canadians number approximately 240,000 and account for roughly 0.7% of Canada's population.[b] A large majority of Tami Canadians consist of Sri Lankan Tamils. The 2021 census also recorded Tamil as the largest [South Asian](/wiki/South_Asia) mother tongue in [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto). While Tamil populations exist in all provinces and territories, the largest concentrations exist in [Southern Ontario](/wiki/Southern_Ontario), [Lower Mainland](/wiki/Lower_Mainland), and [Calgary-Edmonton Corridor](/wiki/Calgary-Edmonton_Corridor). Since the 1970s, Tamils have opened numerous businesses, shops, places of worship, and service-based organizations that cater to the community. They also host yearly major events, such as street festivals and cultural events. Several [Tamil cinema](/wiki/Tamil_cinema) celebrities have hosted major musical and film-based events in major Canadian cities. #### United States [Central New Jersey](/wiki/Central_Jersey) contains the largest population concentration of [Indian Americans](/wiki/Indian_Americans) of Tamil descent. Sizeable populations of [Indian American](/wiki/Indian_American) Tamils have also settled in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City), and [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey) and New York house separate [Tamil Sangams](/wiki/Tamil_Sangam). The [Washington, D.C. metropolitan area](/wiki/Baltimore-Washington_metropolitan_area) on the East Coast as well as Silicon Valley on the West Coast also have Tamil associations. On the other hand, the [New York City](/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area) and [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles) [metropolitan areas](/wiki/Metropolitan_areas) and Central New Jersey are home to the largest concentrations of Tamil-speaking [Sri Lankan Americans](/wiki/Sri_Lankan_American). According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2012-2016 American Community Survey, there are 438,699 people speaking Tamil at home in the US. #### Caribbean #### French West Indies\n",
