  "content": "Sporting event delegation **[Singapore](/wiki/Singapore)** competed at the **[1992 Summer Paralympics](/wiki/1992_Summer_Paralympics)** in [Barcelona](/wiki/Barcelona), [Spain](/wiki/Spain). 4 competitors from Singapore won no medals and so did not place in the [medal table](/wiki/1992_Summer_Paralympics_medal_table). ## Disability classifications Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five [disability categories](/wiki/Summer_Paralympic_Games#Disability_categories); [amputation](/wiki/Amputation), the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; [cerebral palsy](/wiki/Cerebral_palsy); [wheelchair](/wiki/Wheelchair) athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; [visual impairment](/wiki/Visual_impairment), including [blindness](/wiki/Blindness); Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example [dwarfism](/wiki/Dwarfism) or [multiple sclerosis](/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis). Each [Paralympic sport](/wiki/Paralympic_Games#Summer_sports) then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as [athletics](/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2008_Summer_Paralympics), divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example [swimming](/wiki/Swimming_at_the_2008_Summer_Paralympics), group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. ## Athletics NameEvent and disability codeRound reachedPositionResultOng Bah Lee[Raja Singh](/wiki/Raja_Singh)Tang See ChongDerek Yzelman - [Singapore at the Paralympics](/wiki/Singapore_at_the_Paralympics) - [Singapore at the 1992 Summer Olympics](/wiki/Singapore_at_the_1992_Summer_Olympics) This [1992 Summer Paralympics](/wiki/1992_Summer_Paralympics)-related article is a stub.
