  "content": "Building located in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore **The Hive**, also known as **Learning Hub South**, is a building located in [Nanyang Technological University](/wiki/Nanyang_Technological_University), Singapore. The [S](/wiki/Singapore_dollar)$45 million building was designed by [Thomas Heatherwick](/wiki/Thomas_Heatherwick) and completed in 2015. Colloquially, the building is known as the \"[dim sum](/wiki/Dim_sum) basket building\" due to its likeness to the steamer baskets used to contain dim sum. The Hive was a finalist for the 2015 [World Architecture Festival](/wiki/World_Architecture_Festival) Commercial Mixed-Use Award in the Future Projects subcategory. ## Architecture Designed by British designer [Thomas Heatherwick](/wiki/Thomas_Heatherwick), The Hive is Heatherwick Studio's first major building in Asia. The building consists of 12 eight-storey towers arranged around a public atrium. The towers taper towards the base and house 56 corner-less classrooms. The concrete stair and lift cores between the towers are embedded with 700 drawings by British artist [Sara Fanelli](/wiki/Sara_Fanelli), depicting images from science, art and literature. The building has received mixed reviews, with the *[Architectural Review](/wiki/Architectural_Review)* saying that while \"there is much to admire\" about the building, \"it gave off something of a forlorn car-park aesthetic\". - Media related to The Hive, Nanyang Technological University at Wikimedia Commons This article about a Singapore building or structure is a stub.
