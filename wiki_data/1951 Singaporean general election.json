This election followed amendments to the [Constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Singapore#Constitution_of_the_State_of_Singapore_1963_and_its_predecessors) which expanded the number of elected seats from six to nine out of a total of 25 seats. As in (/wiki/1948_Singaporean_general_election), the franchise remained limited to [British subjects](/wiki/British_subjects) who met strict specific residential and income qualifications, with the total number of registered voters only slightly increased to about 48,000. The [Progressive Party](/wiki/Progressive_Party_(Singapore)) (PP) continued to dominate the political landscape, winning six of the nine contested seats. The [Labour Party](/wiki/Labour_Party_(Singapore)) (SLP), which had emerged as a new political force, secured two seats, while the final seat went to an independent candidate. Political participation remained relatively low, with voter turnout at only 52%. Despite the presence of new political actors, the overall control of the Legislative Council remained firmly in the hands of appointed members and the British colonial administration. The 1951 election highlighted the continued limitations of the colonial electoral system. While it represented a modest increase in electoral representation compared to 1948, significant segments of the population, which included most of the Chinese-educated and working-class communities, remained [disenfranchised](/wiki/Disenfranchised). Critics of the system argued that the colonial government's cautious reforms did little to address calls for [genuine self-governance](/wiki/Self-governance_of_Singapore). Nonetheless, the election set the stage for more substantial political changes later in the decade, as political parties and nationalist sentiment began to grow in influence. ## Electoral system The Legislative Council of Singapore was expanded from 22 to 25 members, with the number of popularly elected seats increased from six to nine. Three seats were allocated to representatives nominated by commercial organisations: the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Indian Chamber of Commerce. The remaining 13 members were appointed by the British colonial government and included the [Governor](/wiki/List_of_governors_of_Singapore), [Colonial Secretary](/wiki/Chief_Secretary_(Singapore)), Financial Secretary, [Attorney-General](/wiki/Attorney-General_of_Singapore), Solicitor-General, two departmental directors, two *[ex officio](/wiki/Ex_officio)* commissioners and four non-*ex officio* members. Among the appointed members was [Elizabeth Choy](/wiki/Elizabeth_Choy), a war heroine and social worker, who had previously contested the [1950 Municipal Commission elections](/wiki/1950_Singaporean_Municipal_Commission_election) but was not elected. She was the only woman appointed to the Council. The British authorities also approved a proposal from political parties to redraw constituency boundaries within Singapore. [Six constituencies](/wiki/List_of_Singaporean_electoral_divisions_(1951%E2%80%9355)) were established based on municipal districts, including [Balestier](/wiki/Balestier_Constituency), [Keppel](/wiki/Keppel_Constituency), [Katong](/wiki/Katong_Constituency) and [Tanglin](/wiki/Tanglin_Single_Member_Constituency). In the rural areas, the number of constituencies was increased from two to three, and previously used joint districts were abolished. These changes were intended to reflect population distribution more accurately and to facilitate political contestation within clearer geographic divisions. Despite these adjustments, voting remained non-compulsory, and the franchise continued to be highly restricted. Eligibility was limited to [British subjects](/wiki/British_subjects) over the age of 21 who had resided in Singapore for at least one year as well as specific income qualifications, effectively excluding large segments of the local population from participating in the electoral process. ## Campaign A 32-day campaign period was scheduled, with nomination day set for 8 March 1951. The [Labour Party](/wiki/Labour_Party_(Singapore)) (SLP), which had established itself as the [Progressive Party](/wiki/Progressive_Party_(Singapore)) (PP)'s main political rival at the municipal level, contested seats in the Legislative Council for the first time. Notably, Mansoor bin Adabi, a prominent Malay politician and husband of [Maria Hertogh](/wiki/Maria_Hertogh), the young ethnic Dutch woman whose disputed custody sparked the [Maria Hertogh riots](/wiki/Maria_Hertogh_riots) in late 1950, intended to contest in [Bukit Timah](/wiki/Bukit_Timah_Single_Member_Constituency) under the PP banner. However, he withdrew his nomination at the final moment for reasons that remain unclear. The campaign manager for the PP's vice-chairman [John Laycock](/wiki/John_Laycock) was [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew), then a legal assistant in Laycock's law firm and later the founder of the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) in 1954. 48,155 voters were registered for this election. This number was a small fraction of [Singapore's total population](/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore), which was estimated at around 950,000 in 1951, illustrating the highly restricted nature of the franchise. Several boycott calls had been made in response to these limitations and ongoing political dissatisfaction. Additionally, Singapore was still recovering from the social unrest caused by the Maria Hertogh riots, which occurred roughly four months prior to the election, affecting voter sentiment and turnout. ## Results Voter turnout fell significantly compared to the previous election in 1948, declining by approximately 11 percentage points to 52.05%. Turnout was highest in [Seletar](/wiki/Seletar_Single_Member_Constituency) at 69.2%, while [City](/wiki/City_Constituency) recorded the lowest at just 43.9%. The election was also notable for featuring the first electoral contest for the seat reserved for the Indian Chamber of Commerce; both the Singapore Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce seats were uncontested. [Vilasini Menon](/wiki/Vilasini_Menon) became the first woman elected to the Legislative Council, winning in Seletar as an independent candidate by defeating both the PP and the SLP candidates. PP leader [Tan Chye Cheng](/wiki/Tan_Chye_Cheng) was the most successful candidate in terms of vote share, securing 80% of the votes in Tanglin. By contrast, independent candidate Mizra Abdul Majid received only 4% of the votes in City, becoming the sole candidate to forfeit the $500 election deposit. SLP leader [Lim Yew Hock](/wiki/Lim_Yew_Hock) obtained the highest absolute number of votes, 2,369 in [Keppel](/wiki/Keppel_Constituency), while SLP candidate Thomas Davies Richards was the lowest-performing candidate from a political party by raw votes, polling just 351 in Tanglin. In terms of victory margins, SLP candidate Caralapati Raghaviah Dasaratha Raj won his seat by the narrowest margin of 6.56%, whereas PP leader Tan Chye Cheng achieved the largest margin, winning by 60.27%. The Progressive Party won six out of nine contested seats, making it the first and only party prior to (/wiki/1959_Singaporean_general_election) to secure a two-thirds majority in the Legislative Council, a feat not matched by any other party except the PAP in the future.
