In 1987 it was one of the first buildings in Tanjong Pagar restored by the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority) (URA). It was refurbished into a shopping and recreational centre. There are a seafood restaurant, shops, offices and nightclubs in the present building. ## Architecture Samuel Tomlinson was Municipal Engineer from 1896 to 1902, during which time D.M. Craik was Municipal Architect. The date on the Jinrikisha Station building responds well to the triangular corner site and is typical of many other ornate buildings of the early 1900s. However, originally, the building had exposed [brickwork](/wiki/Brickwork), now painted, and this must have been somewhat unusual at the time. The [Ionic](/wiki/Ancient_Greece) [pilasters](/wiki/Pilaster) and curved [pediment](/wiki/Pediment) on the corner and the square tower with its octagonal [cupola](/wiki/Cupola) are pleasing and important elements of Tanjong Pagar Road and surroundings. ## Notes - National Heritage Board (2002), *Singapore's 100 Historic Places*, Archipelago Press, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 981-4068-23-3 - Norman Edwards, Peter Keys (1996), *Singapore - A Guide to Buildings, Streets, Places*, Times Books International, [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_(identifier)) 9971-65-231-5 This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
