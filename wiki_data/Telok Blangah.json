Telok Blangah is represented by three contiguous subzones of Bukit Merah in [URA](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority) masterplans: Telok Blangah Drive, Telok Blangah Way and Telok Blangah Rise. ## Name The region is named after the [bay](/wiki/Bay). *Telok Blangah* ([Jawi](/wiki/Jawi_alphabet): تلوق بلڠه) is a [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) compound of *[blanga](/wiki/Blanga_(pottery))* \"a type of cooking pot\" and *telok* \"bay\" and so literally means \"cooking bay”. In the ancient maps, Telok Blangah's was often spelled as either Teluk Blanga or Teluk Belanga or Teluk Blangah. *Teluk Blanga* is known as *石叻門* in [Hokkien](/wiki/Min_Nan) ([POJ](/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB): Sit-Lat mn̂g), meaning \"Gate of Singapore\". It is the namesake of the *Teluk Belanga* (modern Malay spelling) style of [Baju Melayu](/wiki/Baju_Melayu), the traditional costume of Malay men. ## History Historically, this area is as old as the thirteenth century city of [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek). The area is rich with [Malay](/wiki/Malay_Singaporeans) aristocratic history of past royal events. According to the [Malay Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals), [Sang Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama)'s boat ran into a storm and he threw everything overboard, including his [crown](/wiki/Crown_(headgear)) before landing just off Telok Blangah beach. The area gained prominence again during the [British](/wiki/British_Empire) period when [Sir Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Sir_Stamford_Raffles) in 1823 assigned [Temenggong Abdul Rahman](/wiki/Temenggong_Abdul_Rahman) (died 1825) and his followers 200 acres (0.81 km2) of land for their [residence](/wiki/Istana_Lama) and a [cemetery](/wiki/Makam_Diraja_Teluk_Blangah). The area flourished under Temenggong Abdul Rahman because of his [monopoly](/wiki/Monopoly) over the [gutta percha](/wiki/Gutta_percha) trade. Temenggong Abdul Rahman's eldest son, Tun Haji Abdullah, informally took over as [Temenggong of Johor](/wiki/Temenggong_of_Johor) after his death in 1825, followed by his second son [Daeng Ibrahim](/wiki/Temenggong_Daeng_Ibrahim) informally in 1833 and officially on 19 August 1841. In 1845, [Telok Blangah Hill](/wiki/Telok_Blangah_Hill) ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language): *Bukit Telok Blangah*) was renamed to [Mount Faber](/wiki/Mount_Faber) after Captain Charles Edward Faber. Following [Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim](/wiki/Temenggong_Daeng_Ibrahim)’s death in 1862, his first son [Temenggong Abu Bakar](/wiki/Temenggong_Abu_Bakar) succeed him and moved his Istana to [Tyersall](/wiki/Tyersall_Park). In 1885, when Maharaja Abu Bakar became the [Sultan of Johor](/wiki/Sultan_of_Johor), he moved to [Johor Bahru](/wiki/Johor_Bahru). The former royal audience hall (now a mosque, [Masjid Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim](/wiki/Masjid_Temenggong_Daeng_Ibrahim)) and the [Johor Royal Mausoleum](/wiki/Makam_Diraja_Johor_Teluk_Blangah) still remain today at Telok Blangah Road, near [VivoCity](/wiki/VivoCity) and Sentosa Gateway. The last to be buried was Ungku Modh. Khalif (or Khalid), the younger brother of Sultan Abu Bakar in 1900. Another Malay royal cemetery and [shrine](/wiki/Shrine) nearby is [Keramat Bukit Kasita](/wiki/Keramat_Bukit_Kasita) at [Bukit Purmei](/wiki/Bukit_Purmei), which is the final resting place of the [Riau-Lingga](/wiki/Riau-Lingga) royal family, a split of the [Johor](/wiki/Johor) royal family. Telok Blangah Road was officially named in 1907. The [sacred shrine](/wiki/Datuk_Keramat) of Puteri Raden Mas Ayu, a sixteenth-century Javanese princess, is located at Mount Faber Road, near the junction with Telok Blangah Road. ## Other Landmarks There are several century-old Chinese temples constructed to meet the spiritual and social needs of the Chinese immigrants who settled in the area around Telok Blangah in the late 1800s. Ban Siew San Kuan Imm Tong (萬壽山觀音堂) and Koon Seng Ting (堃成堂) were built in 1880 and managed to weather through more than 100 years at the same location. Both temples were proposed for conservation under the Draft Master Plan 2013 by Urban Redevelopment Authority. Another prominent old temple in the area will be Telok Blangah Ting Kong Beo (直落布蘭雅天公廟) which was built in 1923 or earlier. ## Infrastructure ### Transportation Telok Blangah is served by the [namesake MRT station](/wiki/Telok_Blangah_MRT_station) of the [Circle line](/wiki/Circle_Line_(Singapore)), located at Telok Blangah Drive subzone.

They are: Blangah Rise Primary School, CHIJ Kellock, Radin Mas Primary School, [CHIJ St. Theresa's Convent](/wiki/CHIJ_Saint_Theresa%27s_Convent) and Shelton College International. ## Politics Telok Blangah is politically divided into two constituencies, [Radin Mas Single Member Constituency](/wiki/Radin_Mas_Single_Member_Constituency) and Telok Blangah division of the [Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency](/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar_Group_Representation_Constituency). The subzones of Telok Blangah Way and Telok Blangah Rise fall under Radin Mas SMC while Telok Blangah Drive fall under Tanjong Pagar GRC.
