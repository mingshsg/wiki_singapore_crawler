  "content": "Cabinet of Singapore since 2025 The **Second Cabinet of Lawrence Wong** of the [Government of Singapore](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore) was announced on 21 May 2025, and came into effect on 23 May 2025. ## Changes Upon his successful [supermajority](/wiki/Supermajority) in the [2025 general election](/wiki/2025_Singaporean_general_election), [Lawrence Wong](/wiki/Lawrence_Wong) stated that his immediate priority was to form the new cabinet, which will be announced \"in due course\" through a press conference and followed by a swearing-in ceremony. He also indicated that NTUC secretary-general [Ng Chee Meng](/wiki/Ng_Chee_Meng) was likely to be included, citing the precedent of labour chiefs playing key roles in past Cabinets. On 5 May, Wong also announced that [Workers' Party](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Singapore))'s (WP) [Pritam Singh](/wiki/Pritam_Singh) would remain as the [opposition leader](/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Singapore)). After a photo of Ng and convicted money launderer [Su Haijin](/wiki/Su_Haijin) was circulated online, Ng requested on 6 May for Wong not to assign him any cabinet position. Ng also apologised for his \"disrespectful\" remarks made to public servants at a 2017 [Ministry of Education](/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)) dialogue. Wong announced the new cabinet line-up on 21 May. Three new coordinating ministers were appointed with [Gan Kim Yong](/wiki/Gan_Kim_Yong) as the only [Deputy Prime Minister](/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Singapore). [Chan Chun Sing](/wiki/Chan_Chun_Sing) assumed roles as defence minister and coordinating minister for public services, while [Desmond Lee](/wiki/Desmond_Lee_(Singaporean_politician)) took over education and [Chee Hong Tat](/wiki/Chee_Hong_Tat) became the national development minister. [Ong Ye Kung](/wiki/Ong_Ye_Kung) became coordinating minister for social policies, and [K. Shanmugam](/wiki/K._Shanmugam) was appointed coordinating minister for national security, with [Edwin Tong](/wiki/Edwin_Tong) taking over law and also serving as second minister for home affairs. [Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim](/wiki/Muhammad_Faishal_Ibrahim) was promoted to senior minister of state for home affairs and acting minister-in-charge of Muslim affairs. Newly-elected Members of Parliament (MP) [Jeffrey Siow](/wiki/Jeffrey_Siow) and [David Neo](/wiki/David_Neo) became acting ministers for transport and culture, community and youth respectively.
