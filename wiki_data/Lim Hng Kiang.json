During the [severe acute respiratory syndrome](/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome) (SARS) epidemic that swept through the region, many Singaporeans felt his initial handling of the crisis, citing his lack of leadership and indecisiveness, helped prolong the epidemic that eventually drove the economy into a recession.[*citation needed*] While then Deputy Prime Minister [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) said \"SARS has significantly disrupted our economy. It has affected not only tourist spending but also domestic consumption... certainly our first half growth will be affected, and we will have to revise down our growth forecasts for the year.\" Others cited his calls to quarantine patients and to close and extend local school holidays were late in coming. Many local residents also pointed to the administrators at [Tan Tock Seng Hospital](/wiki/Tan_Tock_Seng_Hospital) for mishandling and underestimating the severity of SARS. When \"At least 85 percent of people infected by SARS in Singapore caught it while visiting or working at hospitals\", said Osman David Mansoor at the WHO. \"The remainder mostly came down with it at home through close contact with sick family members\", he said. In 2003, Lim was made a minister in the Prime Minister's Office. He retained the role of Second Minister for Finance. Lim was made the Minister for Trade and Industry in 2004. He was subsequently put in charge of trade at the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The ministry was split into two, with Lim taking the trade portfolio and the industry portfolio taken by [S. Iswaran](/wiki/S._Iswaran).
