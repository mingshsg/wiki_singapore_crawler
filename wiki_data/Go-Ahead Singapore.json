  "content": "Public bus operator in Singapore **Go-Ahead Singapore** is a contracted [bus operator](/wiki/Bus_transport_in_Singapore) operating in Singapore. It commenced operations on 4 September 2016 and it is a subsidiary of the [Go-Ahead Group](/wiki/Go-Ahead_Group). ## History On 15 April 2015, the [Land Transport Authority](/wiki/Land_Transport_Authority) called for tenders to operate 25 routes based at [Changi Airport Bus Terminal](/wiki/Changi_Airport_Bus_Terminal), Changi Village Bus Terminal, [Pasir Ris Bus Interchange](/wiki/Pasir_Ris_Bus_Interchange), and [Punggol Bus Interchange](/wiki/Punggol_Bus_Interchange) out of [Loyang Bus Depot](/wiki/Loyang_Bus_Depot) as part of its new [Bus Contracting Model](/wiki/Bus_Contracting_Model). [Busways](/wiki/Busways), [Go-Ahead Group](/wiki/Go-Ahead_Group), [Keolis](/wiki/Keolis), [RATP Dev Transdev Asia](/wiki/RATP_Dev_Transdev_Asia), [SBS Transit](/wiki/SBS_Transit), [SMRT Buses](/wiki/SMRT_Buses), Tian Tan Shipping/[Kumho Buslines](/wiki/Kumho_Asiana_Group) and Woodlands Transport lodged bids. On 23 November 2015, the Land Transport Authority awarded Go-Ahead Singapore the contract with operations to commence in September 2016. The contract will run for five years with a two years extension if it meets LTA's requirements. On 11 December 2015, the Land Transport Authority handed over Loyang Bus Depot to Go-Ahead Singapore to allow it to be fitted out. On 19 June 2016, the Loyang Bus Depot was officially opened by MP for [Pasir Ris-Punggol Group Representation Constituency](/wiki/Pasir_Ris-Punggol_Group_Representation_Constituency), [Zainal Sapari](/wiki/Zainal_Sapari) and the group chief executive of the Go-Ahead Group David Brown. Loyang Bus Depot Carnival was also held on the same day to allow the public to tour the depot and also learn more about Go-Ahead Singapore. Go-Ahead Singapore commenced its operations on 4 September 2016, and took over services from [SBS Transit](/wiki/SBS_Transit) that day and also on 18 September. On 21 September, Go-Ahead Singapore found itself short of staff less than three weeks after launching its services. A total of 30 [SBS Transit](/wiki/SBS_Transit) drivers were deployed at Loyang Bus Depot to operate services 358 and 359, while [SMRT Buses](/wiki/SMRT_Buses) sent 10 drivers to help the new public bus operator operate service 85. [Tower Transit Singapore](/wiki/Tower_Transit_Singapore) was also engaged to supply a staff bus service for Go-Ahead employees at Loyang Bus Depot. On 30 November that year, Go-Ahead Singapore's managing director Nigel Wood left due to \"personal reasons\". He has since resumed his position with [Go-Ahead London](/wiki/Go-Ahead_London) as its general manager. On 19 September 2025, LTA announced that Go-Ahead Singapore had won the bid to operate 27 bus services under the Tampines Bus Package starting from 5 July 2026. Express feeder bus service also introduced bus service 454 will also operate Go Ahead Singapore under Tampines bus package from 5 July 2026. ## Bus routes Go-Ahead Singapore commenced operations of 24 services in two tranches. 13 bus services commenced services on 4 September 2016, while another 11 has started on 18th of that month. All services were previously operated by [SBS Transit](/wiki/SBS_Transit). Expansion therefore followed after the handover, but the operator only allows trunk, feeder, Express and City Direct services. Go-Ahead did not take over NiteOwl 4N, NiteOwl 6N and NightRider NR7 from the former operators, SBS Transit and SMRT Buses.
