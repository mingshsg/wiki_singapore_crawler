Straddling the tip of the southeastern coast of [mainland Singapore](/wiki/Mainland_Singapore), Marine Parade serves as a buffer between the Central and [East](/wiki/East_Region,_Singapore) regions of the country. Bordering it are the planning areas of [Geylang](/wiki/Geylang) to the north, [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang) to the northwest, [Bedok](/wiki/Bedok) to the northeast, [Marina East](/wiki/Marina_East) to the southwest and the [Singapore Straits](/wiki/Singapore_Straits) to the south. Marine Parade is further divided into five subzones, East Coast, [Katong](/wiki/Katong), Marine Parade, Marina East (not to be confused with Marina East, the neighbouring planning area), and [Mountbatten](/wiki/Mountbatten,_Singapore). ## Background Marine Parade's early history can be associated with the precinct of [Katong](/wiki/Katong). Throughout the early to mid 20th century, the area was a haven for the wealthy [Peranakan](/wiki/Peranakan) community of Singapore. Katong witnessed a growth in Straits Chinese culture, developing a distinctive architecture style and even becoming the place of origin for the renowned [Katong Laksa](/wiki/Katong_Laksa) dish. Marine Parade, as it is known today, mainly consists of HDB (Housing Development Board) flats along the southernmost points of the estate. These were built in the 1970s after the reclamation of the island's east coast. Today, many private condominiums are also being built in the area.[*citation needed*] ## Administration Marine Parade has five [subzones](/wiki/List_of_subzones_in_Singapore), which are divisions of planning areas. These five are East Coast, [Katong](/wiki/Katong), Marine Parade, Marina East, and [Mountbatten](/wiki/Mountbatten,_Singapore). As of June 2024, Marine Parade is the most populous subzone at 27,140 residents whilst Marina East and East Coast are the least populous with 0 residents. ## Infrastructure The main public housing estate comprises 58 blocks of [HDB](/wiki/Housing_and_Development_Board) [flats](/wiki/Apartment). The public estate is bisected by the arterial Still Road South that provides access to the major highway, [East Coast Parkway](/wiki/East_Coast_Parkway), leading to the city area and to [Singapore Changi Airport](/wiki/Singapore_Changi_Airport).[*citation needed*] ### Transportation Marine Parade is served by four [Mass Rapid Transit](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) (MRT) stations on the [Thomson–East Coast line](/wiki/Thomson%E2%80%93East_Coast_Line). Two of them, [Marine Parade](/wiki/Marine_Parade_MRT_station) and [Tanjong Katong](/wiki/Tanjong_Katong_MRT_station), are directly in the planning area, whilst the other two, [Marine Terrace](/wiki/Marine_Terrace_MRT_station) and [Katong Park](/wiki/Katong_Park_MRT_station), are at its borders with other planning areas. ### Community Building The [Marine Parade Community Building](/wiki/Marine_Parade_Community_Building) was completed in 2000. It houses the Marine Parade Community Club and the [Marine Parade Public Library](/wiki/Marine_Parade_Public_Library). Other facilities within the three-storey complex include a 263-seater theatrette, a glass-walled gymnasium, a covered [basketball court](/wiki/Basketball_court) on the rooftop, an [air-conditioned](/wiki/Air_conditioning) and a sports hall.
