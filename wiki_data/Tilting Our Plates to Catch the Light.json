  "content": "* **Tilting Our Plates to Catch the Light*** is a poetry collection by the Singaporean poet [Cyril Wong](/wiki/Cyril_Wong) about \"two lovers who are in the process of losing each other,\" bringing into play his background in music, intermingling the lives of gay male-partners with the tribulations of lovers distant and near, including the romance between \"two shape-shifting Hindu deities\", Shiva and Mohini (the female-incarnation of Vishnu). It brings into focus the experience of living with H.I.V. within the homosexual context. The book was chosen by [*The Straits Times*](/wiki/The_Straits_Times) as among the best five books of 2007 and described by the reviewer as \"a luminous symphony\". - [Singapore gay literature](/wiki/Singapore_gay_literature) - [Cyril Wong](/wiki/Cyril_Wong)\n",
