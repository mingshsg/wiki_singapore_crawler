  "content": "City centre in Central Region, Singapore The **Central Area**, also called the **City Area**, and informally **The City**, is the main [commercial](/wiki/Central_business_district) and [financial](/wiki/Financial_centre) [city centre](/wiki/City_centre) of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). Located in the south-eastern part of the [Central Region](/wiki/Central_Region,_Singapore), the Central Area consists of eleven constituent [planning areas](/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore): the [Downtown Core](/wiki/Downtown_Core), [Marina East](/wiki/Marina_East), [Marina South](/wiki/Marina_South), [Museum](/wiki/Museum_Planning_Area), [Newton](/wiki/Newton,_Singapore), [Orchard](/wiki/Orchard,_Singapore), [Outram](/wiki/Outram,_Singapore), [River Valley](/wiki/River_Valley,_Singapore), [Rochor](/wiki/Rochor), the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River) and [Straits View](/wiki/Straits_View), as defined by the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority) (URA). The term **Central Business District** (**CBD**) has also been used to describe most of the Central Area as well, although its boundaries technically lie within the Downtown Core. Singapore's modern history began in this area, when British colonial official [Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles) and representatives of the [British East India Company](/wiki/East_India_Company) landed along the banks of the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River) in 1819 to set up a [free port](/wiki/Free_port) of trade between [Europe](/wiki/Europe) and [Asia](/wiki/Asia). As the old harbour grew along the mouth of the river bank, the [historical city](/wiki/City_of_Singapore_(historical_entity)) naturally expanded around it, creating what is now the Central Area. As the financial heart of Singapore, the Downtown Core also houses the headquarters and offices of numerous major corporations, both local and international, as well as the [Singapore Exchange](/wiki/Singapore_Exchange) (SGX). As the country's *[de facto](/wiki/De_facto)* [capital](/wiki/Capital_city), it is also home to many governmental institutions, most notably the seat of [Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore) and the [Supreme Court](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Singapore). The Central Area surrounds the banks of the Singapore River and [Marina Bay](/wiki/Marina_Bay,_Singapore) where the first settlements on the island were established shortly after the [arrival of Raffles in 1819](/wiki/Founding_years_of_modern_Singapore). Surrounding the Central Area is the rest of the Central Region. The Central Area shares boundaries with the planning areas of [Novena](/wiki/Novena,_Singapore) to the north, [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang) to the north and north-east, [Tanglin](/wiki/Tanglin) to the north-west and west, [Bukit Merah](/wiki/Bukit_Merah) to the south-west and [Marine Parade](/wiki/Marine_Parade) to the east. The south-easternmost limits of the city is enclosed by [Marina Barrage](/wiki/Marina_Barrage), where the mouth of Marina Bay meets the [Singapore Strait](/wiki/Singapore_Strait). ## History ### Early years The Central Area is among the most densely developed parts of Singapore. It represents the historical core of the city, tracing its origins to the [Jackson Plan](/wiki/Jackson_Plan) of the 1820s following the [1819 Singapore Treaty](/wiki/1819_Singapore_Treaty) that marked the beginning of modern-day Singapore. As part of the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements), districts within the Central Area functioned as centres of trade and commerce, particularly the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River) area. Other districts such as [Rochor](/wiki/Rochor), [Newton](/wiki/Newton,_Singapore), [River Valley](/wiki/River_Valley,_Singapore) and [Outram](/wiki/Outram,_Singapore) also maintain strong commercial activity but generally feature fewer [skyscrapers](/wiki/Skyscraper) and a larger proportion of [residential](/wiki/Residential_area) development. These areas include [schools](/wiki/List_of_schools_in_Singapore), [condominiums](/wiki/Condominium_(living_space)) and public [Housing Development Board](/wiki/Housing_Development_Board) (HDB) [flats](/wiki/Apartment), typically commanding higher prices and longer minimum occupation periods due to their status as being located in \"prime areas\". Much of the land around [Telok Ayer Street](/wiki/Telok_Ayer_Street), which today contains a high concentration of commercial skyscrapers, was created through land reclamation carried out over the last century. These include nearby landmarks such as [Lau Pa Sat](/wiki/Lau_Pa_Sat), which was founded as a waterfront market that used to face the [Singapore Strait](/wiki/Singapore_Strait). Parts of the Central Area also reflected historical social and community functions. For example, the shophouses on [Ann Siang Hill](/wiki/Ann_Siang_Hill) were historically used as clan houses by [various Chinese associations](/wiki/Singapore_Federation_of_Chinese_Clan_Associations) in the Chinatown area. Following [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II), acute housing shortages led to the expansion of public housing developments by the [Singapore Improvement Trust](/wiki/Singapore_Improvement_Trust) (SIT) and later the HDB after 1960 in surrounding areas. The Central Area was also been the site of significant historical events, including the [MacDonald House bombing](/wiki/MacDonald_House_bombing) during the *[Konfrontasi](/wiki/Konfrontasi)* in 1965. The attack on the building at [Orchard Road](/wiki/Orchard_Road) resulted in three deaths and injured at least 33 people. ### Since independence From the 1970s, the [Government of Singapore](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore) and the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority) (URA) undertook extensive land reclamation projects at Marina Bay to accommodate the continued growth of the Central Area. These reclaimed areas were planned as [Marina East](/wiki/Marina_East), [Marina South](/wiki/Marina_South) and [Straits View](/wiki/Straits_View), with major commercial and residential developments progressively completed from the 1990s. Today, the Central Area houses the headquarters of numerous [multinational companies](/wiki/Multinational_companies) (MNCs). Singapore's tallest buildings are concentrated around [Raffles Place](/wiki/Raffles_Place) and [Shenton Way](/wiki/Shenton_Way) and are generally subject to a height limit of 280 m (920 ft) pending the decommissioning of [Paya Lebar Airbase](/wiki/Paya_Lebar_Airbase) in the 2030s. Exceptions include [Guoco Tower](/wiki/Guoco_Tower), which reaches 290 m (950 ft), and [Skywaters Residences](/wiki/Skywaters_Residences), which is expected to become the country's first [supertall](/wiki/Supertall) skyscraper at 305 m (1,001 ft) upon its completion in 2028. ## Amenities This section **needs expansion**.

To manage [congestion](/wiki/Traffic_congestion) in the Central Area, the government has introduced a range of measures. These include the installation of [Electronic Road Pricing](/wiki/Electronic_Road_Pricing_(Singapore)) (ERP) gantries, whose operating hours and charges are regularly adjusted to reflect prevailing traffic conditions. The [North–South Corridor](/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_Corridor,_Singapore) (NSE) is also expected to ease traffic flows from the northern parts of Singapore into the Central Area upon its completion in 2029. Public transport plays a central role in supporting access to the Central Area. There are [extensive public bus services](/wiki/Public_buses_of_Singapore) linking the Central Area with other parts of Singapore, including express and city-direct services. The country's [rapid rail transit](/wiki/Rapid_transit) system, the [Mass Rapid Transit](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) (MRT), is particularly dense in the Central Area, which contains more than two dozen stations. Six MRT lines pass through the Central Area, with multiple interchange stations linking the [East–West Line](/wiki/East_West_MRT_Line), the [North–South Line](/wiki/North_South_MRT_Line), the [North East Line](/wiki/North_East_MRT_Line), the [Circle Line](/wiki/Circle_MRT_Line), the [Downtown Line](/wiki/Downtown_MRT_Line) and the [Thomson–East Coast Line](/wiki/Thomson%E2%80%93East_Coast_MRT_Line). - [Architecture of Singapore](/wiki/Architecture_of_Singapore) - [Tourism in Singapore](/wiki/Tourism_in_Singapore) - [City of Singapore (historical entity)](/wiki/City_of_Singapore_(historical_entity)) - [Central Singapore District](/wiki/Central_Singapore_District) - Planning Areas Boundaries Map A, showing extent of the Central Area Archived 7 February 2021 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine)\n",
