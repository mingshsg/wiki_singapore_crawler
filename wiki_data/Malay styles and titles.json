  "content": "Malay-language system of styles, titles and honorifics**This article has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these messages)*This article includes a list of general references, but **it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations**. Please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations. *(February 2009)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*This article **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *Find sources:* \"Malay styles and titles\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(February 2012)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* The [Malay language](/wiki/Malay_language) has a complex system of [styles](/wiki/Style_(manner_of_address)), [titles](/wiki/Title) and [honorifics](/wiki/Honorific) which are used extensively in [Brunei Darussalam](/wiki/Brunei), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, few provinces in the Philippines and several provinces in Indonesia regularly award honorary and life titles.[*citation needed*] What follows in this article is specific to the Malaysian system. References to Brunei and Indonesia are given when pertinent. In Malaysia, all non-[hereditary titles](/wiki/Hereditary_title) can be granted to both men and women. Every title has a [form of address](/wiki/Form_of_address) which can be used by the wife of the title holder. This form is not used by the husband of a titled woman; such a woman will bear a title which is the same as a titled man.[*citation needed*] ## Former usage [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), whose Malay royalty was abolished by the [British colonial government](/wiki/Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements) in 1891, has adopted civic titles for its leaders. However, when the officials and leaders who were bestowed the Malay titles by Malaysia and Brunei, the title will be only referred to on their visit to the title's state's local media. Much of the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines) was [historically](/wiki/History_of_the_Philippines_(900%E2%80%931521)) accustomed to the usage of Malay titles by [its royals and nobles](/wiki/Principalia), such as [Raja Sulayman](/wiki/Raja_Sulayman) and [Dayang Kalangitan](/wiki/Dayang_Kalangitan) in Luzon. Malay titles are still prominently used by the royal houses of [Sulu](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Sulu) and [Maguindanao](/wiki/Sultanate_of_Maguindanao) among other noble lineages in [Mindanao](/wiki/Mindanao) in preservation of genealogies. Officially, the republic does not grant royal or noble titles according to the [1987 Constitution](/wiki/1987_Constitution). [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), meanwhile, as a republic, does not recognise hereditary rulers and aristocratic systems outside of [Yogyakarta](/wiki/Yogyakarta_Sultanate). ## Usage The sequence that should be used when formally writing or addressing a person's name is: honorary style, professional rank, royal hereditary title, federal title, state title, non-royal hereditary title, Doctor (of medicine or philosophy), Haji/Hajah (for [Muslim](/wiki/Muslim) men and women who have performed the [Hajj](/wiki/Hajj)), name. For instance, in Brunei, the [Wazir](/wiki/Vizier_(Brunei)) is a group of royal nobles, namely one of the royal princes who is *gahara* (pure descendants of the [Sultan](/wiki/Sultan_of_Brunei)), are the second-highest official post in the nation, right behind the Sultan. Following this, the [Cheteria](/wiki/Cheteria), only bestowed upon the [Pengiran](/wiki/Pengiran), who perform specific jobs and are ranked above the [Manteri](/wiki/Manteri), a group of non-royal nobles. An example of a Manteri would be the former [police commissioner of Brunei](/wiki/Royal_Brunei_Police_Force), [Hasrin Sabtu](/wiki/Hasrin_Sabtu), whose honorary title would be *Yang Dimuliakan* ([The Exalted One](/wiki/Excellency)), noble rank is *Pehin Orang Kaya Pendikar Alam*, state title is *[Dato Paduka Seri](/wiki/Order_of_Paduka_Keberanian_Laila_Terbilang)* and traditional Bruneian prefix title for non-royalty is *Awang* (Mr.). When in the home state, the state title may precede the [federal title](/wiki/Orders,_decorations,_and_medals_of_Malaysia#Federal_orders,_decorations,_and_medals). An example is the current [Premier of Sarawak](/wiki/Premier_of_Sarawak), [Abang Abdul Rahman Zohari Abang Openg](/wiki/Abang_Abdul_Rahman_Zohari_Abang_Openg), whose federal title is *Tan Sri*, whose state title is *Datuk Patinggi* and Bruniean title is *Dato Seri Setia*. His title will be expressed as either: - *Yang Amat Berhormat Tan Sri Datuk Patinggi* (Dr.) Abang Haji Abdul Rahman Zohari bin Tun Datuk Abang Haji Openg (federally) - *Yang Amat Berhormat Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri* (Dr.) Abang Haji Abdul Rahman Zohari bin Tun Datuk Abang Haji Openg (in his home state). - *Yang Amat Berhormat Tan Sri Dato Seri Setia* (Dr.) Abang Haji Abdul Rahman Zohari bin Tun Datuk Abang Haji Openg (in [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei)). Another exception is when a person has received an award from a state other than the person's home state; when visiting the award-bestowing state, that state's title will take the place of a home state's title (if any). As an example, the current Prime Minister, [Anwar Ibrahim](/wiki/Anwar_Ibrahim) will be titled as follows: - *Yang Amat Berhormat Dato' Seri* Anwar bin Ibrahim (federally) - *Yang Amat Berhormat Datuk Seri Panglima* Anwar bin Ibrahim (in [Sabah](/wiki/Sabah)) - *Yang Amat Berhormat Dato' Seri Utama* Anwar bin Ibrahim (in [Penang](/wiki/Penang)) - *Yang Amat Berhormat Dato' Seri Diraja* Anwar bin Ibrahim (in [Perlis](/wiki/Perlis)) A style carried by virtue of royal title always trumps those carried by non-royal titles. Male royals may choose to append 'al-Haj' to their name instead of using 'Haji'. The following example is correct: - *Yang Amat Mulia* General Tengku Dato' (name) al-Haj. ## Malay royalty The following titles are hereditary and reserved for the royal families of [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei) and nine royal states of [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia). ### Brunei According to royal customs established during the reign of [Sultan](/wiki/Sultan_of_Brunei) [Hassanal Bolkiah](/wiki/Hassanal_Bolkiah), and based on knowledge passed down by elders, any name, rank, title, position, or honorific must be preceded by a *terasul* before being mentioned or written. This tradition reflects the deep respect for hierarchical and cultural values in Brunei. Given that Brunei is an absolute monarchy, the correct use of official titles for members of the royal family is essential. Incorrect usage can cause discomfort or be perceived as disrespectful, emphasising the importance of adhering to these formal protocols. *Terasul* for the Sultan: - Before reaching puberty: *Kebawah Duli Sultan* (followed by the Sultan's given name). -

These honours may also be revoked by the *Yang di-Pertuan Agong* or returned by the individual. Some of the highest honours bestowed carries with them the titles of *Tun*, *Tan Sri*, or *Datuk*. There is a maximum number of Malaysian subjects who may be award-holders at any one time. These numerical limits apply only to Malaysian subjects. Foreigners may be awarded such titles in a supernumerary and honorary capacity, and may use the title locally. ### Tun The *Tun* title has existed in Malay traditional society for hundreds of years. In ancient times, *Tun* was an honorific title used by noble people of royal lineage, inherited by the male descendants. Over time, the *Tun* title has become a title conferred by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to the most-deserving recipient who has highly contributed to the nation. *Tun* is the most senior federal title awarded to recipients of either the *Seri Maharaja Mangku Negara* ([Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm](/wiki/Order_of_the_Defender_of_the_Realm#Grand_Commander)) (SMN) or *Seri Setia Mahkota* ([Grand Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia](/wiki/Order_of_Loyalty_to_the_Crown_of_Malaysia#Grand_Commander)) (SSM). However, the SMN and SSM are [not the highest federal awards](/wiki/Orders,_decorations,_and_medals_of_Malaysia#Federal_orders,_decorations,_and_medals), ranking fourth and fifth, respectively. There may not be more than 25 (SMN) and 35 (SSM) living holders of each of these awards respectively at any one time. The title for the wife of a *Tun* is called *Toh Puan*. The recipients and their wives are then bestowed with the style of *Yang Amat Berbahagia* or (The Most Honourable). The SMN is usually awarded to newly appointed *Yang di-Pertua Negeri* (YDPN), and to all the retired [Prime Ministers of Malaysia](/wiki/Prime_Ministers_of_Malaysia), with the exception of [Tunku Abdul Rahman](/wiki/Tunku_Abdul_Rahman) (he is the Prince of the state of [Kedah](/wiki/Kedah)), [Najib Razak](/wiki/Najib_Razak), [Muhyiddin Yassin](/wiki/Muhyiddin_Yassin), and [Ismail Sabri Yaakob](/wiki/Ismail_Sabri_Yaakob). Examples: - *Yang Amat Berbahagia* (The Most Honourable) *Tun* [Dr.](/wiki/Physician) [Mahathir Mohamad](/wiki/Mahathir_Mohamad) [SMN](/wiki/Order_of_the_Defender_of_the_Realm#Grand_Commander); - *Yang Amat Berbahagia* (The Most Honourable) *Tun* [Dr.](/wiki/Dr.) [Ling Liong Sik](/wiki/Ling_Liong_Sik) [SSM](/wiki/Order_of_Loyalty_to_the_Crown_of_Malaysia). ### Tan Sri *Tan Sri* is the second-most senior federal title and a honorific, used to denote recipients of the *Panglima Mangku Negara* ([Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm](/wiki/Order_of_the_Defender_of_the_Realm#Commander)) (PMN) and the *Panglima Setia Mahkota* ([Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia](/wiki/Order_of_Loyalty_to_the_Crown_of_Malaysia#Commander)) (PSM). The wife of a *Tan Sri* is called *Puan Sri*. The recipients and their wives are then bestowed with the style of *Yang Berbahagia* or (The Honourable). Examples: - *Tan Sri Datuk Amar* [P. Ramlee](/wiki/P._Ramlee) - *Yang Berhormat Tan Sri Dato' Haji* [Muhyiddin Yassin](/wiki/Muhyiddin_Yassin) [PSM](/wiki/Order_of_Loyalty_to_the_Crown_of_Malaysia#Commander); - *Yang Berbahagia Tan Sri Datuk Seri Panglima* [Abdul Gani Patail](/wiki/Abdul_Gani_Patail) [PMN](/wiki/Order_of_the_Defender_of_the_Realm#Commander); - *Yang Berbahagia Tan Sri* Dr [Runme Shaw](/wiki/Runme_Shaw), [K.St.J](/wiki/Order_of_Saint_John_(chartered_1888)); - *Yang Berbahagia Tan Sri Dato' Seri* [Michelle Yeoh](/wiki/Michelle_Yeoh) [PSM](/wiki/Order_of_Loyalty_to_the_Crown_of_Malaysia#Commander); - *Yang Berbahagia Tan Sri Dato Sri* Dr [Muhammad Shafee Abdullah](/wiki/Muhammad_Shafee_Abdullah) [PSM](/wiki/Order_of_Loyalty_to_the_Crown_of_Malaysia). ### Datuk *Datuk* is a federal title that has been conferred since (/wiki/1965_in_Malaysia). It is limited to recipients of *Panglima Jasa Negara* ([Commander of the Order of Meritorious Service](/wiki/Order_of_Meritorious_Service#Commander)) (PJN) and *Panglima Setia Diraja* ([Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Royal Family of Malaysia](/wiki/Order_of_Loyalty_to_the_Royal_Family_of_Malaysia#Commander)) (PSD). There may be up to 200 living PJN holders and 200 living PSD holders at any one time. The title of the wife of a male Datuk is *Datin*; women with the title can take either the title *Datin* or *Datuk*. The recipients and their wives are then bestowed with the style of *Yang Berbahagia* (The Honourable). Examples: - *Yang Berbahagia Datuk* [Lee Chong Wei](/wiki/Lee_Chong_Wei) [PJN](/wiki/Order_of_Meritorious_Service#Commander); - *Yang Berbahagia Datuk* [Punch Gunalan](/wiki/Punch_Gunalan) [PSD](/wiki/Order_of_Loyalty_to_the_Royal_Family_of_Malaysia#Commander); - *Yang Berbahagia Datuk* Ahmad Fauzi Hasan; - *Yang Berbahagia Datuk* Prof. Dr. Mohamad Akram Laldin. ### Dato In Brunei, the title *Dato* is now comparable to the [Commonwealth](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations)'s [Sir](/wiki/Sir) and is frequently used with a great non-royal chief. ## State titles In Malaysia, state honours are awarded by the respective heads of the [thirteen states](/wiki/States_of_Malaysia). Such titles are honorary and non-hereditary. State titles may be revoked or suspended by the head of state, or may be returned by the individual. Dato' Sri or Dato' Seri (sometimes Dato’ is spelled and pronounced Datuk in some states) is the highest state title conferred by the Ruler on the most deserving recipients who have contributed greatly to the nation or state. It ranks below the federal title Tun, and is an honour equivalent to federal title Tan Sri. The wife of a recipient is Datin Sri or Datin Seri. In many cases, the number of Malaysian nationals who may hold a state title or honour at one time is limited. Such limits do not apply to foreigners.

[Sarawak](/wiki/Sarawak)Grand Commander of the [Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak](/wiki/Order_of_the_Star_of_Hornbill_Sarawak) (PGBK) ### Pehin This title is mainly used in Brunei Darussalam. An example of the title in Brunei would be *Pehin Orang Kaya Laila Setia Bakti Di-Raja Dato Laila Utama* Haji Awang [Isa](/wiki/Isa_bin_Ibrahim), the former Minister of Home Affairs and the current Special Adviser to the Sultan of Brunei. The titles refers to the [traditional ministers posts in Brunei](/wiki/Manteri). ### Pehin Sri This title is mainly used in [Sarawak](/wiki/Sarawak). Awarded to individuals who have been appointed as Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak or equivalent or higher. An example of the title in Sarawak would be Tun Pehin Sri Haji [Abdul Taib Mahmud](/wiki/Abdul_Taib_Mahmud), Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak. ### Seri Setia This title is mainly used in [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca). Awarded to individuals who have been appointed as Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Malacca or equivalent or higher. An example of the title in Malacca would be Tun Seri Setia (Dr.) Haji [Mohd Ali Rustam](/wiki/Mohd_Ali_Rustam), Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Malacca. ### JP [Justice of Peace](/wiki/Justice_of_the_Peace#Malaysia) (JP) ranks below all *Dato'* or *Datuk*. In Malaysia, Justices of Peace have largely been replaced in magistrates' courts by legally-qualified (first-class) stipendiary [magistrates](/wiki/Magistrate). However, state governments continue to appoint Justices of Peace as honours. In (/wiki/2004_in_Malaysia), some associations of JPs pressed the federal government to allow JPs to sit as second-class magistrates to reduce the backlog of cases in the courts. ## Special cases If a person has been awarded several honours from different states, the title used varies. For example, sometimes former Prime Minister, [Mahathir Mohamad](/wiki/Mahathir_Mohamad) is usually referred to as *YABhg Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad* anywhere in Malaysia. However, different terms of address *may* be used in the states that he visits. In Sarawak, he will be referred to as *YABhg Tun Pehin Sri Mahathir Mohamad* as he received the [Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of Sarawak](/wiki/Most_Exalted_Order_of_the_Star_of_Sarawak#Knight_Grand_Commander) (SBS) from the [Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak](/wiki/Yang_di-Pertua_Negeri_of_Sarawak). While in Sabah, he is referred to as *Tun Datuk Seri Panglima Dr. Mahathir Mohamad*, as he received the [Grand Commander of the Order of Kinabalu](/wiki/Order_of_Kinabalu#Grand_Commander) (SPDK) from the [Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sabah](/wiki/Yang_di-Pertua_Negeri_of_Sabah). ## Honorary styles The following are used as styles, both before a person's title, and by themselves as forms of address: - *Tuan Yang Terutama* (TYT) (lit. 'The Most Eminent Master') – the style of a state governor, equivalent to 'Your/His Excellency', and also as a title for serving Ambassadors to Malaysia, e.g. T.Y.T. Tuan [Brian D. McFeeters](/wiki/Brian_D._McFeeters). Previously, the archaic equivalent to the style *His Excellency*. This was used by Singapore, Indonesia, and in Malaysia; for other Republic's leaders, while the style for Governors / Yang di-Pertuas were Tuan *Yang Terutama*. - *Yang Amat Berhormat* (YAB) (lit. 'The Right Honourable') – the style of the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the [Premier of Sarawak](/wiki/Premier_of_Sarawak), the chief ministers and the [Menteri Besars](/wiki/Chief_Ministers_in_Malaysia) of the states, and Tuns who are members of parliament. It used to be 'the Right Honorable', but since Malaysia withdrew as a member of the [Privy Council](/wiki/Privy_Council) in the 1990s, the right to use 'Right Honourable' has been revoked. - *Yang Berhormat* (YB) (lit. 'The Honourable') – the style of members of parliament and state legislative assemblymen. The prefix *Yang Berhormat* is also used for recipients of the First and Second Classes of the [Johor's Orders of Chivalry](/wiki/List_of_post-nominal_letters_(Johor)) who is titled Dato' for men and Datin Paduka for women, regardless of whether a member of parliament or not. - *Yang Berhormat Mulia* (YBM) (lit. 'His/Her Noble Honour') - the style for a member of royalty who is also a member of parliament (e.g. Yang Berhormat Mulia [Tengku Zulpuri Shah Raja Puji](/wiki/Tengku_Zulpuri_Shah_Raja_Puji), the MP for [Raub](/wiki/Raub_(federal_constituency))). This style is also used by royals with high ranking federal titles such as Tun (eg. Yang Berhormat Mulia Tun [Raja Uda](/wiki/Raja_Uda)). - *Yang Amat Arif* (YAA) (lit.

[Mahathir Mohamad](/wiki/Mahathir_Mohamad) mentioned that one of the problems with titles in Malaysia is the numbers of them given out. He stated in an interview \"Personally, I feel if you want to give value to anything, it must be limited... if you produce a million Ferrari cars, nobody will care about buying a Ferrari.\" The Sultan [Nazrin Shah of Perak](/wiki/Nazrin_Shah_of_Perak), stated \"That is my view. You degrade the award and the Ruler has the right to revoke it. In my opinion, it should be taken away.\" He also stated that \"Sometimes, I think we give away too many datukships... it dilutes and devalues the award.\"[*This quote needs a citation*] In the first government following the independence of Malaya in 1957, 5 of 15 cabinet Ministers were Datuks. The [Minister of Finance of Malaysia](/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(Malaysia)) at the time, [Tan Siew Sin](/wiki/Tan_Siew_Sin), held the title [Justice of Peace](/wiki/Justice_of_Peace).

The Malacca government was criticised for awarding the *Datuk* title to a non-Malaysian Indian actor, [Shah Rukh Khan](/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan), for making movies and promoting the Malacca state internationally. In 2024, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Sultan [Ibrahim Iskandar of Johor](/wiki/Ibrahim_Iskandar_of_Johor), stated \"If a recipient is found to have tarnished the country’s image or commits a crime and has been punished by the court, then the award will be withdrawn. (Say) Goodbye to it.\" He also stated that \"Accordingly, I have instructed the government to check the list of inmates in all prisons. I want any inmate with federal awards or honours to have their award withdrawn. This is only for federal awards and honours.
