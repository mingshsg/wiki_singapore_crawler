The drain-sweeper is entitled to hold that key, and I am to see that he gets it.\" In 1960, Yong proposed an idea of [post-primary](/wiki/Post-primary), where students who fail their [Primary School Leaving Examination](/wiki/Primary_School_Leaving_Examination) (PSLE) would take two more years of primary school before joining a normal secondary school.

In 1966, Yong introduced a scheme at hospitals for victims of factory or traffic accidents to help pay for most of their expenses. In 1967, he stated plans to halve [Singapore's birthrate](/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore#Population_growth) from 30 per thousand to 15 per thousand by 1970, by the time the five-year family planning programme, launched last year, ends. ### Minister for Communications (1968–1975) In 1968, while he served as the Minister for Communications, he proposed the idea of converting military bases for commercial use.
