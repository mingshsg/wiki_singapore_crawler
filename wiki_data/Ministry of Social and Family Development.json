  "content": "Singaporean government ministry The **Ministry of Social and Family Development** (**MSF**; [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language): *Kementerian Pembangunan Sosial dan Keluarga*; [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 社会及家庭发展部; [Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_language): சமுதாய, குடும்ப மேம்பாட்டு அமைச்சு) is a [ministry](/wiki/Ministry_(government_department)) of the [Government of Singapore](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore) responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies related to the community infrastructure, programmes and services in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). ## History MSF was formed on 1 November 2012, after it was announced on 31 July 2012 that the [Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports](/wiki/Ministry_of_Community_Development,_Youth_and_Sports) would be restructured. Several portfolios, including youth and sports development, charity governance and [REACH](/wiki/REACH_(Singapore)), the Government's feedback unit, were taken over by two other new Ministries - [Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth](/wiki/Ministry_of_Culture,_Community_and_Youth) and [Ministry of Communications and Information](/wiki/Ministry_of_Communications_and_Information). ## Responsibilities One of MSF's immediate priorities was to re-examine public policies to help get Singaporeans to marry and have their first child earlier. In addition, MSF would work on strengthening the [social safety net](/wiki/Social_safety_net) to better help those in need, especially those who are at risk. ## Statutory Boards - [National Council of Social Service](/wiki/National_Council_of_Social_Service) - [National Council on Problem Gambling](/wiki/National_Council_on_Problem_Gambling_(Singapore)) ## Impact In June 2018, the [Save The Children](/wiki/Save_The_Children) organisation's End of Childhood report ranked Singapore as the best country for children to grow up in. Its ranking methodology is based on eight indicators - under-five mortality rate, child stunting, out-of-school children and youth, child labour, child marriage, adolescent birth rate, child homicide rate and population displaced by conflict. ## Ministers The Ministry is headed by the **Minister for Social and Family Development**, who is appointed as part of the [Cabinet of Singapore](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Singapore).
