During 2013, DirectAsia had gross written premiums of $25.3 million. In 2014, DirectAsia was acquired by Hiscox Insurance to commit further to serving customers in Asia. Hiscox has reached a $55 million agreement with Whittington Group. DirectAsia was Hiscox's first business in Asia and built on its other direct-to-consumer operations in Europe and the US. Simon Birch, the former managing director of Direct Asia, left that business in July 2015 following its acquisition by Hiscox.[*better source needed*] In March 2016, Hiscox group agreed to sell the Hong Kong division of DirectAsia business to WellLink. In October 2016, DirectAsia Group was announced as an Official Partner of [Leicester City](/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.) Football Club for the 2016/17 season. In October 2018, DirectAsia partnered with Prudential Singapore. In 2024, Roojai Group, a Thai online insurance brokerage, acquired DirectAsia Thailand from Hiscox. Following the acquisition, DirectAsia’s Thailand operations were rebranded as [Roojai Insurance](/wiki/Roojai_Insurance), while its Singapore business retained the DirectAsia name. ## Investigation In 2021, DirectAsia and 11 other insurance companies became victims of fraud by a Singaporean woman Wendy Tan Phaik Sim. She's defrauding 12 insurers of SG$30,900 through numerous false travel insurance claims for delayed baggage, despite not going on holidays.\n",
