  "content": "Indonesian sauce made from ground roasted or fried peanuts **Peanut sauce**, **satay sauce** (**saté sauce**), ***bumbu kacang***, ***sambal kacang***, or ***pecel*** is a sauce made from ground roasted or fried [peanuts](/wiki/Peanut), widely used in [Indonesian cuisine](/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine) and many other dishes throughout the world.[*failed verification*] Peanut sauce is used with meat and vegetables, with grilled skewered meat, such as [satay](/wiki/Satay), poured over vegetables as [salad dressing](/wiki/Salad_dressing) such as in *[gado-gado](/wiki/Gado-gado)*, or as a [dipping sauce](/wiki/Dipping_sauce). ## Ingredients Many different recipes for making peanut sauces exist, resulting in a variety of flavours, textures and consistency. The main ingredient is ground roasted peanuts, for which [peanut butter](/wiki/Peanut_butter) can act as a substitute. Other typical ingredients include [coconut milk](/wiki/Coconut_milk), [soy sauce](/wiki/Soy_sauce), [tamarind](/wiki/Tamarind), [galangal](/wiki/Galangal), [garlic](/wiki/Garlic), and [spices](/wiki/Spice) (such as [coriander seed](/wiki/Coriander_seed) or [cumin](/wiki/Cumin)). Other possible ingredients are [chili peppers](/wiki/Chili_pepper), [sugar](/wiki/Sugar), fried [onion](/wiki/Onion), and [lemongrass](/wiki/Lemongrass). The texture and consistency of a peanut sauce mainly reflect the amount of water being mixed in it. ## Regional ### Indonesia Peanuts were introduced from [the Americas](/wiki/The_Americas) by [Spanish](/wiki/Spanish_people) merchants into Indonesia in the late 16th century. Peanuts thrived in the tropical environment of Southeast Asia.[*citation needed*] In [Indonesian cuisine](/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine), they are found roasted and chopped in dishes and in marinades, and as dipping sauces. *Bumbu kacang* (peanut sauce) features in many Indonesian signature dishes, such as [satay](/wiki/Satay), *[gado-gado](/wiki/Gado-gado)*, *[karedok](/wiki/Karedok)*, *[ketoprak](/wiki/Ketoprak_(food))*, *[rujak](/wiki/Rujak)* and *[pecel](/wiki/Pecel)*, or Chinese-influenced dishes such as *[siomay](/wiki/Siomay)*. It is usually added to main ingredients (meat or vegetables) to add taste, used as dipping sauce such as *sambal kacang* (a mixture of ground chilli and fried peanuts) for *[otak-otak](/wiki/Otak-otak)*, or as a dressing on salads. [Satay](/wiki/Satay), a popular [Southeast Asian](/wiki/List_of_Asian_cuisines#Southeast_Asian_cuisine) [street food](/wiki/Street_food), is a dish commonly presented as skewered, grilled meat served with peanut sauce. Its popularity has caused the name \"satay\" to be used to describe both the sauce and the dish. In sauces, fried peanuts are often combined with *gula jawa* ([palm sugar](/wiki/Palm_sugar)), [garlic](/wiki/Garlic), [shallot](/wiki/Shallot), [ginger](/wiki/Ginger), [tamarind juice](/wiki/Tamarind_juice), [lemon](/wiki/Lemon) juice, [lemongrass](/wiki/Lemongrass), [salt](/wiki/Salt), [chilli](/wiki/Chili_pepper), [pepper](/wiki/Black_pepper), and [kecap manis](/wiki/Kecap_manis) (sweet soy sauce). Combinations of these ingredients are ground together and mixed with coconut milk or water. Indonesian peanut sauce tends to be less sweet than its [Thai](/wiki/Thai_cuisine) adaptation.[*citation needed*] ### Netherlands Peanut sauce reached the [Netherlands](/wiki/Netherlands) through its [former colonization of South East Asia](/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies). Besides being used in certain traditional Indonesian and [Dutch-Indonesian](/wiki/Indo_people) dishes, it has found its way into a purely Dutch context as a condiment when it is eaten during, for instance, a (non-Asian style) [barbecue](/wiki/Barbecue) or with [French fries](/wiki/French_fries). A popular combination at Dutch [fast food](/wiki/Fast_food) outlets is French fries with [mayonnaise](/wiki/Mayonnaise) and peanut sauce (often with raw chopped [onions](/wiki/Onion) and with ketchup or Dutch currysauce), called a *patatje oorlog* (lit. 'Fries War'). Peanut sauce is also eaten with [baguette](/wiki/Baguette), [bread](/wiki/Bread), [cucumber](/wiki/Cucumber) or [potatoes](/wiki/Potato). It is also used as an ingredient in the deep-fried snack food called *satékroket*, a [croquette](/wiki/Croquette) made with a flour-[thickened](/wiki/Thickening_agent) [ragout](/wiki/Ragout) based on Indonesian satay.[*citation needed*] ### Other countries This section **does not cite any sources**.
