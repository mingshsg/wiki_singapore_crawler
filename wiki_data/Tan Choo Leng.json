  "content": "Singaporean lawyer **Tan Choo Leng** ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 陈子玲; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *Chén Zǐlíng*) is a Singaporean lawyer. Choo is the spouse of the second [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore), [Goh Chok Tong](/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong). Choo took the role of the spouse of the [Prime Minister of Singapore](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) between 1990 and 2004. ## Early life and career Tan graduated from the University of Singapore (now the [National University of Singapore](/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore)) with [Bachelor of Laws](/wiki/Bachelor_of_Laws) degree. She is currently an [advocate](/wiki/Advocate) and [solicitor](/wiki/Solicitor) for [WongPartnership](/wiki/WongPartnership) LLP. ## Controversy She has given her support to many charities, and was best known for being a patron of the [National Kidney Foundation](/wiki/National_Kidney_Foundation_Singapore) (NKF). During the [2005 NKF scandal](/wiki/National_Kidney_Foundation_Singapore_scandal), she commented that the annual salary of S$600,000 drawn by NKF's chief executive officer [T. T. Durai](/wiki/T._T._Durai) was considered \"peanuts\" as compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars managed by the NKF. Her remark was subsequently met with negative reactions from many Singaporeans. Tan stepped down as a patron after Durai and the NKF's board of directors resigned under public pressure on 14 July 2005. Senior Minister [Goh Chok Tong](/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong) later told the press that his wife regretted making that comment. This article about a politician from Singapore is a stub.
