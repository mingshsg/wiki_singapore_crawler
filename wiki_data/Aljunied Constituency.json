  "content": "Historical constituency in Aljunied, Singapore **Aljunied Constituency** was a constituency in [Aljunied](/wiki/Aljunied), Singapore that was formed in 1959 and continued throughout till 1988. In 1988, following the establishment of [Group representation constituency](/wiki/Group_representation_constituency) (GRC) and SMC, the constituency was merged with other constituencies to form the [Aljunied GRC](/wiki/Aljunied_Group_Representation_Constituency). ## History During the nomination day for the [1959 general election](/wiki/1959_Singaporean_general_election), [Singapore Alliance](/wiki/Singapore_Alliance_Party)'s candidate, [Lim Koon Teck](/wiki/Lim_Koon_Teck)'s nomination to contest Aljunied Constituency was rejected by an assistant returning officer. [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)'s candidate [S. V. Lingam](/wiki/S._V._Lingam) had objected to the nomination of Lim as the serial number of Lim's proposer was not filled in on the duplicate of the nomination forms. Lim decided to appeal against the objection with an elections petition. As the electoral petition can only be filed after the elections are held, Lim decided not to file the petition as he did not wish the electorate of the constituency to have a by-election so soon after the general election, if his petition was successful. Lingam won the election. ## Member of Parliament YearMemberParty**Formation**[Legislative Assembly of Singapore](/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore)(/wiki/1959_Singaporean_general_election)[Suppiah Visva Lingam](/wiki/S._V._Lingam)[a][PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)(/wiki/1963_Singaporean_general_election)[Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore)1965[Suppiah Visva Lingam](/wiki/S._V._Lingam)[PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)(/wiki/1968_Singaporean_general_election)Mohamad Ghazali bin Ismail(/wiki/1972_Singaporean_general_election)[Chin Harn Tong](/wiki/Chin_Harn_Tong)(/wiki/1976_Singaporean_general_election)(/wiki/1980_Singaporean_general_election)(/wiki/1984_Singaporean_general_election)**Constituency abolished (1988)** ## Electoral results Note: The [Elections Department](/wiki/Elections_Department_Singapore) does not include rejected votes when calculating the vote shares of candidates.
