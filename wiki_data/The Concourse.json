  "content": "Mixed-use skyscraper in Singapore **The Concourse** ([simplified Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 鸿福中心; [traditional Chinese](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 鴻福中心; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *Hóngfú zhōngxīn*) is a [post-modern](/wiki/Postmodern_architecture) high-rise [commercial](/wiki/Commercial_property) and [residential](/wiki/Residential_property) building on [Beach Road](/wiki/Beach_Road,_Singapore) [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang), Singapore opposite [Nicoll Highway MRT station](/wiki/Nicoll_Highway_MRT_station). The Concourse is located in Singapore's \"Golden Mile\", which refers to the strip of land between [Nicoll Highway](/wiki/Nicoll_Highway) and Beach Road. It was planned by the [Singapore Government](/wiki/Singapore_Government) as a high-rise spine fronting [Kallang Basin](/wiki/Kallang_Basin). The area used to be occupied by [squatters](/wiki/Squatter) and small marine industries. The Concourse's site was acquired in competition in the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority)'s 8th Sales of Sites programme in 1979. A project, developed by [Cheong Eak Chong](/wiki/Cheong_Eak_Chong)'s Hong Fok Corporation, commenced in 1981 as the **Hong Fok Centre** but construction stopped when [Singapore's economy](/wiki/Singapore%27s_economy) was hit by a [recession](/wiki/Recession) in the mid-1980s. In 1987, the [architectural firm](/wiki/Architectural_firm) Architects 61 and architect [Paul Rudolph](/wiki/Paul_Rudolph_(architect)) re-designed the complex. They retained what was already constructed, and revamped the remainder in order to accommodate new [programmatic](/wiki/Brief_(architecture)) requirements. Built at a cost of [S$](/wiki/S$)248.1 million and to a height of 175 metres (574 ft) for its office [tower](/wiki/Tower), The Concourse was completed on 5 February 1994. ## Architecture This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *Find sources:* \"The Concourse\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(January 2018)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* The Concourse is a [mixed-use development](/wiki/Mixed-use_development), comprising a 41-story office tower, a three-level retail [podium](/wiki/Podium) and nine storeys of [serviced apartments](/wiki/Serviced_apartment). The three distinct components, with their different usage, have separate [entrances](/wiki/Door). These overlook the traditional low-rise [shophouses](/wiki/Shophouse) and office blocks in the Beach Road area. Paul Rudolph designed The Concourse as a \"Tropical Skyscraper\". His use of [solar](/wiki/Sun) [shading](/wiki/Shading), wide [overhangs](/wiki/Overhang_(architecture)), and communal gardens and external [balconies](/wiki/Balconies) has some similarities with the ideas advanced by [Ken Yeang](/wiki/Ken_Yeang) for the [bioclimatic](/wiki/Bioclimatic) skyscraper. The [correlation](/wiki/Correlation) between form and [function](/wiki/Functionalism_(architecture)) arises out of Rudolph's grounding in [modern architecture](/wiki/Modern_architecture), for he was taught by [Walter Gropius](/wiki/Walter_Gropius) at [Harvard University](/wiki/Harvard_University). Approaching the [city](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore) from [Singapore Changi Airport](/wiki/Singapore_Changi_Airport), The Concourse's tower stands out as a landmark because of its distinctive [silhouette](/wiki/Silhouette) when viewed from across the [Kallang Basin](/wiki/Kallang_Basin). The tower is [octagonal](/wiki/Octagon) in [plan](/wiki/Plan_view), as the number \"(/wiki/8_(number))\" for the octagon is associated with [prosperity](/wiki/Prosperity) in [Chinese culture](/wiki/Chinese_culture), and is typical of Paul Rudolph's buildings. It is also supported by huge [pilotis](/wiki/Pilotis), a feature that is shared with The Colonnade in Singapore. The distinctive soaring effect of the tower is accentuated by these lofty [columns](/wiki/Column) on the first storey which also effectively elevate the building, but is mitigated by the [faceted](/wiki/Facet) façade of the serviced apartments and retail podium. The Concourse's most prominent architectural feature is the aluminium [curtain wall](/wiki/Curtain_wall_(architecture)) system incorporating inclined [windows](/wiki/Window) that form clusters of units. These interlocking clusters are stacked vertically, like [dinner plates](/wiki/Dinner_plate), one above the other, [rotating](/wiki/Rotating) around the building. A five-storey [atrium](/wiki/Atrium_(architecture)) [lobby](/wiki/Lobby_(room)) greets visitors to The Concourse, and 14 sky-atria within the tower form [reception](/wiki/Waiting_room) lobbies for [multinational corporations](/wiki/Multinational_corporation) and organisations. The serviced apartment units in the lower block vary in size, and facilities include a swimming pool, [squash courts](/wiki/Squash_court) and a [fitness centre](/wiki/Fitness_centre). The apartments overlook Nicoll Highway and the [Kallang River](/wiki/Kallang_River) Basin. [Shops](/wiki/Retailing) are arranged around a three-storey sky-lit atrium in the retail podium. Due to its unique and unconventional [building design](/wiki/Building_design), a [scale model](/wiki/Scale_model) of The Concourse once went for an architectural [exhibition](/wiki/Art_exhibition) tour around the world. ## Gallery - Wong, Yunn Chii; Tan, Kok Hiang; Siew, Man Kok; Low, Chwee Lye (2005). *Singapore 1:1 – city : a gallery of architecture & urban design*.
