  "content": "Island country in Southeast Asia **Singapore**,[f] officially the **Republic of Singapore**, is an [island country](/wiki/Island_country) and [city-state](/wiki/City-state) in [Southeast Asia](/wiki/Southeast_Asia). Its territory comprises [one main island](/wiki/Singapore_Island), [63 satellite islands and islets](/wiki/List_of_islands_of_Singapore), and [one outlying islet](/wiki/Pedra_Branca,_Singapore). The country is about one [degree of latitude](/wiki/Degree_of_latitude) (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the [equator](/wiki/Equator), off the southern tip of the [Malay Peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula), bordering the [Strait of Malacca](/wiki/Strait_of_Malacca) to the west, the [Singapore Strait](/wiki/Singapore_Strait) to the south along with the [Riau Islands](/wiki/Riau_Islands) in [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), the [South China Sea](/wiki/South_China_Sea) to the east and the [Straits of Johor](/wiki/Straits_of_Johor) along with the [State of Johor](/wiki/Johor) in [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) to the north. In [its early history](/wiki/Early_history_of_Singapore), Singapore was a maritime [emporium](/wiki/Emporium_(antiquity)) known as *[Temasek](/wiki/Temasek)*; subsequently, it was a major constituent of several successive [thalassocratic](/wiki/Thalassocratic) empires. Its contemporary era began in 1819, when [Stamford Raffles](/wiki/Stamford_Raffles) established Singapore as an [entrepôt trading post](/wiki/Entrep%C3%B4t) of the [British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire). In 1867, Singapore came under direct British control as part of the [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements). During [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II), Singapore was [occupied by Japan](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore) in 1942 and returned to Britain as a [Crown colony](/wiki/Colony_of_Singapore) following [Japan's surrender](/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan) in 1945. Singapore gained [self-governance](/wiki/Self-governance_of_Singapore) in 1959 and in (/wiki/Malaysia_Agreement) became part of the new federation of [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), alongside [Malaya](/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya), [North Borneo](/wiki/Crown_Colony_of_North_Borneo) and [Sarawak](/wiki/Crown_Colony_of_Sarawak). [Ideological differences](/wiki/State_of_Singapore_(Malaysia)) led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation two years later; it became an independent [sovereign country](/wiki/Sovereign_state) in 1965. After early years of [turbulence](/wiki/History_of_the_Republic_of_Singapore#1965_to_Late_1970s) and despite lacking natural resources and a [hinterland](/wiki/Hinterland), the nation rapidly developed to become one of the [Four Asian Tigers](/wiki/Four_Asian_Tigers). As a highly [developed country](/wiki/Developed_country), Singapore has the [highest PPP-adjusted GDP per capita](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita) in the world and is the only country in Asia with a AAA [sovereign credit rating](/wiki/Credit_rating#Sovereign_credit_ratings) from [all major rating agencies](/wiki/Big_Three_(credit_rating_agencies)). Identified as a [tax haven](/wiki/Tax_haven), it is a major [aviation](/wiki/Airline_hub), [financial](/wiki/Financial_centre) and [maritime shipping](/wiki/Port) hub and has consistently been ranked as one of the [most expensive cities](/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_cities_for_expatriate_employees) for [expatriates](/wiki/Expatriate) and [foreign workers](/wiki/Foreign_worker). Singapore ranks highly in key social indicators: [education](/wiki/Education_in_Singapore), [healthcare](/wiki/Healthcare_in_Singapore), [housing](/wiki/Public_housing_in_Singapore), [peacefulness](/wiki/Global_Peace_Index), [passport strength](/wiki/Henley_Passport_Index), [personal safety](/wiki/Crime_in_Singapore) and [infrastructure](/wiki/Infrastructure), with a high [home-ownership rate](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate). [Singaporeans](/wiki/Singaporeans) enjoy one of the [longest life expectancies](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy), [fastest Internet connection speeds](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds), [lowest infant mortality rates](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_and_under-five_mortality_rates) and [lowest levels of corruption](/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index) in the world. Singapore is [organised](/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Singapore) into five [regions](/wiki/Regions_of_Singapore), 55 [planning areas](/wiki/Planning_areas_of_Singapore) and hundreds of [subzones](/wiki/Subzones_of_Singapore). It has the [third highest population density of any country](/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density), although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of [urban planning](/wiki/Urban_planning). With a multicultural population and in recognition of the cultural identities of the country's major ethnic groups, Singapore has four [official languages](/wiki/Languages_of_Singapore): [English](/wiki/Singaporean_English), [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language), [Mandarin](/wiki/Singaporean_Mandarin) and [Tamil](/wiki/Tamil_language). English is the [common language](/wiki/Lingua_franca), with exclusive use in numerous [public services](/wiki/Public_service). [Multi-racialism](/wiki/Multiculturalism) is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape [national policies](/wiki/Race_in_Singapore). Singapore is a [parliamentary republic](/wiki/Parliamentary_republic) and its legal system is based on [common law](/wiki/Common_law). While it is [constitutionally](/wiki/Constitution_of_Singapore) a [multi-party democracy](/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Singapore) where [free elections](/wiki/Elections_in_Singapore) are regularly held, it functions as a *[de facto](/wiki/De_facto)* [one-party state](/wiki/Dominant-party_system), with the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) maintaining continuous political dominance since (/wiki/1959_Singaporean_general_election). The PAP's longstanding control has resulted in limited [political pluralism](/wiki/Pluralism_(political_theory)) and a highly centralised governance structure over national institutions. One of the five founding members of [ASEAN](/wiki/ASEAN), Singapore is also the headquarters of the [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation](/wiki/Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation) Secretariat, the [Pacific Economic Cooperation Council](/wiki/Pacific_Economic_Cooperation_Council) Secretariat and is the host city of many [international conferences and events](/wiki/MICE_(Meetings,_Incentives,_Conferences,_Exhibitions)_tourism). Singapore is also a member of the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations), the [World Trade Organization](/wiki/World_Trade_Organization), the [East Asia Summit](/wiki/East_Asia_Summit), the [Non-Aligned Movement](/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement) and the [Commonwealth of Nations](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations). ## Name and etymology The [English](/wiki/English_language) name of \"Singapore\" is an [anglicisation](/wiki/Anglicisation) of the native [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) name for the country, *Singapura* (Malay pronunciation: [siŋapura] ), which was in turn derived from the [Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit) word for 'lion city' ([Sanskrit](/wiki/Sanskrit_language): सिंहपुर; [romanised:](/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration) *Siṃhapura*; [Brahmi](/wiki/Brahmi_script): 𑀲𑀺𑀁𑀳𑀧𑀼𑀭; literally \"lion city\"; *siṃha* means 'lion', *pura* means 'city' or 'fortress'). [Pulau Ujong](/wiki/Singapore_Island) was one of the earliest references to Singapore Island, which corresponds to a Chinese account from the third century referred to a place as *[Pú Luó Zhōng](/wiki/Pulau_Ujong)* ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 蒲 羅 中), a transcription of the [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) name for 'island at the end of [a peninsula](/wiki/Malay_Peninsula)'. Early references to the name *[Temasek](/wiki/Temasek)* (or *Tumasik*) are found in the [Nagarakretagama](/wiki/Nagarakretagama), a [Javanese](/wiki/Java_(island)) [eulogy](/wiki/Eulogy) written in 1365, and a [Vietnamese](/wiki/Vietnam) source from the same time period. The name possibly means *Sea Town*, being derived from the [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) *tasek*, meaning 'sea' or 'lake'. The [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_people) traveller [Wang Dayuan](/wiki/Wang_Dayuan) visited a place around 1330 named *Danmaxi* ([Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language): 淡馬錫; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *Dànmǎxí*; [Wade–Giles](/wiki/Wade%E2%80%93Giles): *Tan Ma Hsi*) or *Tam ma siak*, depending on pronunciation; this may be a transcription of *[Temasek](/wiki/Temasek)*, alternatively, it may be a combination of the [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language) *Tanah* meaning 'land' and [Chinese](/wiki/Chinese_language) *xi* meaning '[tin](/wiki/Tin)', which was traded on the island. Variations of the name *Siṃhapura* were used for a number of cities throughout the region prior to the establishment of the [Kingdom of Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura). In [Hindu–Buddhist culture](/wiki/Buddhism_and_Hinduism), lions were associated with power and protection, which may explain the attraction of such a name. The name *Singapura* supplanted *[Temasek](/wiki/Temasek)* sometime before the 15th century, after the establishment of the [Kingdom of Singapura](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura) on the island by a fleeing Sumatran *[Raja](/wiki/Raja)* (prince) from [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang). However, the precise time and reason for the name change is unknown. The semi-historical [Malay Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals) state that [Temasek](/wiki/Temasek) was christened *Singapura* by [Sang Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama), a 13th-century Sumatran *[Raja](/wiki/Raja)* from [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang). [The Annals](/wiki/Malay_Annals) state that [Sang Nila Utama](/wiki/Sang_Nila_Utama) encountered a strange beast on the island that he took to be a lion. Seeing this as an omen, he established the town of *Singapura* where he encountered the beast.: 37, 88–92 : 30–31 The second hypothesis, drawn from [Portuguese sources](/wiki/Tom%C3%A9_Pires#The_Suma_Oriental), postulates that this mythical story is based on the real life [Parameswara](/wiki/Parameswara_(king)) of [Palembang](/wiki/Palembang). [Parameswara](/wiki/Parameswara_(king)) declared independence from [Majapahit](/wiki/Majapahit) and mounted a Lion Throne. After then being driven into exile by the [Javanese](/wiki/Javanese_people), he usurped control over *[Temasek](/wiki/Temasek)*. He may have rechristened the area as *Singapura*, recalling the throne he had been driven from. Under [Japanese occupation](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore), Singapore was renamed *Syonan-to* ([Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_language): 昭 南, [Hepburn](/wiki/Hepburn_romanization): *Shōnan*), meaning 'light of the south'. Singapore is sometimes referred to by the nickname the \"Garden City\", in reference to its parks and tree-lined streets. Another informal name, the \"[Little Red Dot](/wiki/Little_red_dot)\", was adopted after an article in the *[Asian Wall Street Journal](/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal_Asia)* of 4 August 1998 said that [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesia) President [B. J. Habibie](/wiki/B._J._Habibie) referred to Singapore as a red dot on a map. ## History ### Ancient Singapore\n",
