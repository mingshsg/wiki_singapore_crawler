  "content": "City in Singapore (1951–1965)City The **City of Singapore**[a] was a [city](/wiki/British_overseas_cities) within the [Colony of Singapore](/wiki/Colony_of_Singapore), a [British](/wiki/British_Empire) [crown colony](/wiki/Crown_colony), and later formed part of the [State of Singapore](/wiki/Singapore_in_Malaysia) within [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), administered by the [City Council](/wiki/City_Council_of_Singapore) as its local governing authority. Before 1951, the City Council was known as the [Municipal Commission](/wiki/Municipal_Commission_of_Singapore), and the area was referred to as the **Town of Singapore**. Singapore was formally accorded [city status](/wiki/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom) by the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom) in 1951. The remainder of the crown colony outside the city was administered by the Singapore Rural Board. The city functioned as the [capital](/wiki/Capital_city) of Singapore until its abolishment in 1965. Today, the [Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore), which sits in the south-eastern corner of Singapore, mostly corresponds with what was once the City of Singapore, and the usage of \"Singapore\" now refers to all of the territories under the [Republic of Singapore](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore) as a [city-state](/wiki/City-state). ## History ### Creation and subsequent elections In the (/wiki/1948_Singapore_general_election) and [1951 general elections](/wiki/1951_Singapore_general_election) in Singapore, constituencies were drawn along the boundary of the Municipal Commission and the Rural Board, each area was subdivided into a number of constituencies. The municipality was then conferred with city status by a [royal charter](/wiki/Royal_charter) from [King George VI](/wiki/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom) on 22 September 1951, when Singapore was then a Crown colony. The original Municipal Commission was therefore renamed as the City Council, and the Municipal Building was renamed [City Hall](/wiki/Former_City_Hall,_Singapore). Between the [1957 election](/wiki/1957_Singapore_City_Council_election) and the phasing out of the city, [Ong Eng Guan](/wiki/Ong_Eng_Guan) of the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) was the [mayor](/wiki/Mayor_of_Singapore) as the [leader](/wiki/Leader_of_the_Council) of the largest party within the City Council. Ong went on to become [Minister of National Development](/wiki/Ministry_of_National_Development_(Singapore)) under [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew)'s [premiership](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore). ### Dissolution After the PAP gained power following the [1959 general election](/wiki/1959_Singapore_general_election) and formed the first government after [self-government](/wiki/Self-government) was granted to the Crown colony, the city was phased out, with powers transferred to statutory boards. In 1965, upon Singapore's expulsion from [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), the *[Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965](/wiki/Constitution_of_Singapore#Republic_of_Singapore_Independence_Act)* provided the following clause which empowered the President to abolish the City Council and the Rural Board, with the powers of the local authorities assumed by the Government. > [President](/wiki/President_of_Singapore) may by order make such modifications in any written law as appear to him to be necessary or expedient in consequence of the abolition of the City Council and of the Rural Board and of the assumption of the powers of the local authorities by the [Government](/wiki/Singapore_Government). - [British overseas cities](/wiki/British_overseas_cities) - [City status in the United Kingdom](/wiki/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom) - [George Town, Penang](/wiki/George_Town,_Penang) - [Victoria, Hong Kong](/wiki/Victoria,_Hong_Kong) - [List of cities in Malaysia](/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Malaysia) ## Notes\n",
