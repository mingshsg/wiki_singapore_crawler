Singapore supports the concept of [Southeast Asian](/wiki/Southeast_Asia) regionalism and plays an active role in the [Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)](/wiki/Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations), of which it is a founding member. Being a key member of ASEAN and a global hub, Singapore maintains favourable relations with many countries, and embodies building friendships and mutual benefits in its foreign policy. The nation works closely with neighboring and regional countries, specifically in [Asia-Pacific](/wiki/Asia-Pacific), and consistently supports international initiatives to maintain peace, security and order. It is part of the [non-aligned movement](/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement) and adopts a balanced position regarding major power contestation. Due to its status, Singapore is the headquarters of the [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation](/wiki/Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation) (APEC) Secretariat, the [Pacific Economic Cooperation Council](/wiki/Pacific_Economic_Cooperation_Council) (PECC) Secretariat, and is the host city of many [international conferences and events](/wiki/MICE_(Meetings,_Incentives,_Conferences,_Exhibitions)_tourism). Singapore is also a member of the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations), [World Trade Organization](/wiki/World_Trade_Organization), [East Asia Summit](/wiki/East_Asia_Summit), [Non-Aligned Movement](/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement), the [Commonwealth of Nations](/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) and a founding member of the [Forum on Small States](/wiki/Forum_on_Small_States) (FOSS). Due to geographical reasons, relations with [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia%E2%80%93Singapore_relations) and [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia%E2%80%93Singapore_relations) are most important. Historical baggage, including separation from Malaysia and [Konfrontasi](/wiki/Konfrontasi) with Indonesia, have caused a [siege mentality](/wiki/Siege_mentality) of sorts. Singapore enjoys good relations with the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom) which shares ties in the [Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA)](/wiki/Five_Power_Defence_Arrangements) along with [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia), [Australia](/wiki/Australia) and [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand). Singapore also enjoys robust defense ties with the United States while simultaneously maintaining good relations with [China](/wiki/China). Additionally, it is one of the few countries to establish relations with both [North Korea](/wiki/North_Korea) and the United States. As part of its role in the United Nations, Singapore held a rotational seat on the [UN Security Council](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council) from 2001 to 2002. Singapore has consistently supported the '[rules-based international order](/wiki/Liberal_international_order)' and it has participated in UN peacekeeping/observer missions in [Kuwait](/wiki/Kuwait), [Angola](/wiki/Angola), [Kenya](/wiki/Kenya), [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia) and [Timor Leste](/wiki/Timor_Leste). ## Timeline Source: - 7 August 1965 – Singapore and Malaysia sign the [separation agreement](/wiki/Independence_of_Singapore_Agreement_1965). - 9 August 1965 – The [Malaysian Parliament](/wiki/Dewan_Rakyat) votes to expel Singapore from the Federation; Singapore becomes an independent republic after separating from Malaysia.[*citation needed*] Malaysia immediately recognises the new independent state of Singapore.: 44 - 9 August 1965 – [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Singapore)) was established and [S.

Its foreign policy focused on seeking recognition and building diplomatic relations with other countries. Singapore pursued a policy of non-alignment and sought to establish itself as a reliable partner in the international community. - Economic Development and Trade (1970s-1980s): In the 1970s, Singapore began to prioritize economic development and trade as key pillars of its foreign policy. The government implemented pro-business policies, attracted foreign investments, and actively pursued trade agreements with various countries. Singapore also joined regional organizations like ASEAN in 1967 to enhance economic cooperation and promote stability in Southeast Asia. - Regional Security and ASEAN (1980s-1990s): As Singapore grew economically, it became increasingly concerned about regional security. It played an active role in promoting regional stability through initiatives like the Five Power Defense Arrangements (FPDA) and the Zone of Peace, Freedom, and Neutrality (ZOPFAN). Singapore supported the establishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1994, which aimed to enhance security cooperation and dialogue among ASEAN and its partners. - Pragmatic Diplomacy and Bilateral Relations (1990s-2000s): Singapore's foreign policy during this period emphasized pragmatic diplomacy and building strong bilateral relations with major powers. It sought to diversify its partnerships and engaged with countries like the United States, China, and India to enhance economic ties, attract investments, and promote regional stability. Singapore also hosted several high-profile international events and conferences to bolster its diplomatic profile. - Economic Integration and Free Trade (2000s-Present): In the 2000s, Singapore continued to prioritize economic integration and free trade. It actively pursued bilateral and regional free trade agreements (FTAs) to expand market access and boost economic growth. Notable agreements include the Singapore-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (2003), the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with India (2005), and participation in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). - Global Engagement and Multilateralism: Singapore has increasingly engaged in global affairs and actively participated in multilateral institutions. It has sought to shape global norms and contribute to issues such as climate change, sustainable development, and cybersecurity. Singapore has been assessed as one of the three potential internationally leading countries on climate policy in Asia. Singapore has played an active role in organizations like the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), and ASEAN to advance its interests and contribute to international cooperation. ## Foreign policy approaches Singapore's leaders are [realists](/wiki/Realism_(international_relations)); they perceive a [Hobbesian](/wiki/Hobbes) world where might makes right. Even so, there are shades of [liberalism](/wiki/Liberalism_(international_relations)) and [constructivist](/wiki/Constructivism_(international_relations)) thought in its foreign policy as evinced by the belief that economic interdependence will lessen the chances of conflict and that Singapore cannot be fatalistic as a small country. The resultant [siege mentality](/wiki/Siege_mentality) is due to Singapore's geographical weaknesses, mistrust of Malaysia and Indonesia due to historical baggage, and from how it stands out as a \"little red dot in a sea of green\", as then-President [Habibie](/wiki/B._J._Habibie) of Indonesia put it. Singapore's first foreign minister was [S. Rajaratnam](/wiki/S._Rajaratnam), and the country's foreign policy still bears his imprimatur. Rajaratnam originally framed Singapore's foreign policy, taking into account \"the jungle of international politics\", and was wary of foreign policy \"on the basis of permanent enemies.\" In 1966, S. Rajaratnam saw Singapore's challenge as ensuring its sustained survival, peace, and prosperity in a region suffering from mutual jealousies, internal violence, economic disintegration and great power conflicts. In accordance with this worldview, Singapore's foreign policy is aimed at maintaining friendly relations with all countries, especially Malaysia, Indonesia, and ASEAN, and ensuring that its actions do not exacerbate its neighbours' insecurities. In 1972, Rajaratnam envisioned the world being Singapore's hinterland – integration into the world economy would ameliorate Singapore's inherent lack of natural resources. Thus, Rajaratnam believed that maintaining a [balance of power](/wiki/Balance_of_power_in_international_relations), rather than becoming a de facto vassal of some larger power, would provide Singapore with freedom to pursue an independent foreign policy. The cultivation of the great powers' interest in Singapore also would effectively function to deter the interference of regional powers. ## Trade agreements EconomyAgreementAbbreviationConcludedSignedEffectiveLegal textNew Zealand[Agreement between New Zealand and Singapore on a Closer Economic Partnership](/wiki/Agreement_between_New_Zealand_and_Singapore_on_a_Closer_Economic_Partnership)ANZSCEP18 August 200014 November 20001 January 2001[European Free Trade Association](/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association)Agreement between the EFTA States and SingaporeEFTA-Singapore FTA11 April 200226 June 20021 January 2003JapanAgreement between Japan and the Republic of Singapore for a New-Age Economic PartnershipJSEPAOctober 200113 January 2002United States[United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement](/wiki/United_States-Singapore_Free_Trade_Agreement)USSFTA19 November 20026 May 20031 January 2004[Jordan](/wiki/Jordan)Singapore Jordan Free Trade AgreementSJFTA29 April 200416 May 2004[Brunei](/wiki/Brunei)[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement](/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Strategic_Economic_Partnership_Agreement)Trans-Pacific SEPAugust 20051 January 2006[Chile](/wiki/Chile)18 July 2005New Zealand18 July 2005India[India - Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement](/wiki/India%E2%80%93Singapore_Comprehensive_Economic_Cooperation_Agreement)India-Singapore CECANovember 200429 June 20051 August 2005[Korea](/wiki/South_Korea)Korea-Singapore Free Trade AgreementKSFTA28 November 20044 August 2005End 2005[Peru](/wiki/Peru)Peru-Singapore Free Trade AgreementPesFTASeptember 200729 May 2008Early 2009 ## International organizations ### APEC The [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation](/wiki/Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation) (APEC) is based in Singapore, of which Singapore is a founding member of. Singapore has long recognised the importance of APEC as an essential platform for promoting economic linkages and its benefits towards strengthening regional peace and security between member economies. Singapore has endorsed APEC's efforts at regional economic integration as well as its non-trade agendas of human resource development, emergency preparedness and health. Singapore has since hosted the APEC forum in 2009. ### INTERPOL The International Criminal Police Organization [INTERPOL](/wiki/INTERPOL) has opened its Global Complex for Innovation, or IGCI, in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) in 2015. As of 2016, the IGCI houses a global Command and Coordination Centre, the Organization's Capacity Building and Training Directorate, an Innovation Centre annex Cyber Research Lab, and the Cybercrime Directorate, which also incorporates the building's Cyber Fusion Centre. The building is also used for large-scale projects and operations with a global impact, law enforcement trainings and cross-sector conferences with a nexus in the [ASEAN](/wiki/ASEAN) region. ### G20 Singapore, although not a [G20](/wiki/G20) member, has been invited to participate in G20 summits and its related processes in 2010, 2011 and from 2013 to 2017 as a representative of the Global Governance Group. In February 2017, Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr [Vivian Balakrishnan](/wiki/Vivian_Balakrishnan) attended the G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting in Bonn. ## Diplomatic relations List of countries which

The government of Singapore believes that regional security, and by extension, Singapore's security will be affected if the United States loses its resolve in Iraq. Defence Relations Singapore and the US have strong defence relations; Singapore buys a large number of weapon systems from the US, and has close ties such as the [F-16](/wiki/F-16) detachment stationed at [Luke Air Force Base](/wiki/Luke_Air_Force_Base). In return, the [United States Navy](/wiki/United_States_Navy) is allowed to use Singaporean naval facilities, including the newly constructed [Changi Naval Base](/wiki/Changi_Naval_Base) designed with USN [aircraft carriers](/wiki/Aircraft_carrier) in mind. Under a Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1990, the United States military is permitted to use [Paya Lebar Airbase](/wiki/Paya_Lebar_Airbase) and Sembawang wharves; a US naval logistic unit was established in Singapore in 1992. Singapore routinely hosts American ships and American fighter aircraft. More than 100 American Navy warships call at Singapore annually, and there is a modest presence of less than 200 US military personnel based permanently in Singapore. Several naval bases in Singapore were built to US specifications, so as to allow American ships, especially carriers, to dock. In 2011, the US Navy announced plans to station several of its new [Littoral combat ships](/wiki/Littoral_combat_ships) in Singapore permanently. Singapore also signed 'The Strategic Framework Agreement for a Closer Cooperation Partnership in Defence and Security' with the United States in 2005. The agreement gives a formal structure to addressing existing and future areas of bilateral security and defence cooperation. The Singapore government believes that regional security, and by extension Singapore's security, will be affected if the United States loses its resolve in Iraq. Singapore faces the threat of terrorism itself, as evidenced by the [Singapore embassies attack plot](/wiki/Singapore_embassies_attack_plot). Singapore has pushed regional counter-terrorism initiatives, with a strong resolve to deal with terrorists inside its borders. To this end it has given support to the US-led coalition to fight terrorism, with bilateral cooperation in counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation initiatives, and joint military exercises. Relations with the United States have expanded in other areas, and the two countries take part in joint policy dialogues. The Regional Emerging Diseases Intervention Centre (REDI), opened on 24 May 2004, is a joint US-Singapore collaboration to promote cooperation in tackling emerging infectious diseases. The centre facilitates the exchange of information and expertise on surveillance; prevention and control of, and research on, communicable and non-communicable diseases; and on bioterrorism concerns. In July 2005, during his official visit to the [United States](/wiki/United_States), Prime Minister [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) and President [George W. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush) signed a [Strategic Framework Agreement](/wiki/Strategic_Framework_Agreement) (SFA) to strengthen defence and security cooperation. The Prime Minister again visited in the United States in May 2007. Trade In 2003, Singapore and the United States signed the [United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement](/wiki/United_States-Singapore_Free_Trade_Agreement) (USSFTA), which came into force in January 2004. This is the first [free trade agreement](/wiki/Free_trade_agreement) into which U.S. entered with an East Asian country. Others In 1994, relations with the U.S. were hampered for a brief period by the caning incident of American teenager [Michael P. Fay](/wiki/Michael_P._Fay) who was convicted in Singapore for vandalism. In September 2005, Singapore [responded to the relief effort](/wiki/Singaporean_response_to_Hurricane_Katrina) in the wake of [Hurricane Katrina](/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina) in the United States. Four Singaporean [CH-47 Chinook helicopters](/wiki/CH-47_Chinook) and 45 [RSAF](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force) personnel from a training detachment based in [Grand Prairie](/wiki/Grand_Prairie), [Texas](/wiki/Texas), were sent to help in relief operations. They are operating out of [Fort Polk](/wiki/Fort_Polk) in cooperation with the Texas Army National Guard. ### Asia CountryFormal Relations BeganNotes [Armenia](/wiki/Armenia)1 July 1992See [Armenia–Singapore relations](/wiki/Armenia%E2%80%93Singapore_relations) Both countries established diplomatic relations on 1 July 1992.

[Brunei](/wiki/Brunei)See [Brunei–Singapore relations](/wiki/Brunei%E2%80%93Singapore_relations) Brunei and Singapore have a currency agreement that the currencies of both countries can be used in either of the two countries. The [Brunei dollar](/wiki/Brunei_dollar) and the [Singapore dollar](/wiki/Singapore_dollar) are maintained at parity. In August 2005, [Brunei](/wiki/Brunei)'s Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister, Prince [Mohamed Bolkiah](/wiki/Mohamed_Bolkiah) arrived in Singapore for a three-day visit during which the two countries signed an agreement to eliminate double taxation, paving the way for further bilateral trade and investment. The [Royal Brunei Navy](/wiki/Royal_Brunei_Navy) and the [Republic of Singapore Navy](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Navy) conduct an annual Exercise Pelican signifying strong ties between the two navies. [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia)See [Cambodia–Singapore relations](/wiki/Cambodia%E2%80%93Singapore_relations) - Cambodia has an embassy in Singapore. - Singapore has an embassy in [Phnom Penh](/wiki/Phnom_Penh). [China](/wiki/China)See [China–Singapore relations](/wiki/China%E2%80%93Singapore_relations) Sino-Singaporean ties began much earlier than the founding of the [People's Republic of China](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China) in October 1949. Migrant Chinese labourers escaping poverty and war came to what was known as Nanyang to the Chinese to Singapore which was part of British Malaya. Many ethnic Chinese Singaporeans derived their ancestral roots in southern China from [Fujian](/wiki/Fujian), [Guangdong](/wiki/Guangdong) and [Hainan](/wiki/Hainan) provinces. Diplomatic ties between the two countries officially began on 3 October 1990. Singapore was the last country in South East Asia to formally recognise People's Republic of China out of respect to Indonesia, sensitivities in the region and fears from neighbouring countries of communism in those times. Singapore still maintains cooperation with ROC in terms of military training and facilities from an agreement in 1975. This is due to a lack of usable space in built-up Singapore. Hence China has offered Singapore to relocate some of its training facilities from Taiwan to Hainan province. Bilateral ties took a dive when Singapore's deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong travelled to [Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan) for a private visit in 2004. Later in 2004, Chinese government put bilateral relations on hold. On 19 September 2005, Vice Premier [Wu Yi](/wiki/Wu_Yi_(politician)) of the [People's Republic of China](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China) arrived in Singapore for a three-day visit. She led a delegation of ministers and senior officials at the 2nd Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation between the PRC and Singapore. On 14 November 2010, Vice President Xi Jinping visited Singapore on a three-day visit to further develop bilateral ties. His visit also commemorated the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Singapore is China's 9th largest trading partner. While China is Singapore's 3rd largest trading partner which consisted of 10.1 percent of Singapore's total external trade from the previous year. Other examples of close ties between Singapore and China include Singapore helping China to build up its industries such as the [Suzhou Industrial Park](/wiki/Suzhou_Industrial_Park). Singaporeans have also donated generously in the aftermath of the [2008 Sichuan earthquake](/wiki/2008_Sichuan_earthquake). Since 17 April 2011 Chinese and Singaporean diplomatic, official and official ordinary passport holders able to enjoy 30-day transit visa-free service for entering each other's country. In September 2012, the first China-Singapore Social Management Senior Forum was held in Singapore, and the two sides signed an exchange of notes on strengthening social management cooperation. In April 2013, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong attended the annual meeting of the Boao Forum for Asia and visited Guangdong. In March 2013, the People's Bank of China and the Monetary Authority of Singapore renewed the bilateral local currency swap agreement between China and Singapore, and the swap scale was expanded to 300 billion yuan/60 billion Singapore dollars. [East Timor](/wiki/Timor-Leste)20 May 2002 - Both countries established diplomatic relations on 20 May 2002. - East Timor has an embassy in Singapore. - Singapore is accredited to East Timor from its embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia. [India](/wiki/India)See [India-Singapore relations](/wiki/India-Singapore_relations) India and Singapore share long-standing cultural ties with more than 300,000 people of Indian origin living in Singapore. Singapore was one of the first to respond to [India's \"Look East\" Policy](/wiki/Look_East_policy_(India)) of expanding its economic, cultural and strategic ties in Southeast Asia to strengthen its standing as a [regional power](/wiki/Regional_power). Singapore, and especially, the Singaporean Foreign Minister, [George Yeo](/wiki/George_Yeo), have taken an interest in establishing the [Nalanda University](/wiki/Nalanda_University). Strategic Relations Following its independence in 1965, Singapore was concerned with PRC-backed threats as well as domination from [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia) and sought a close strategic relationship with India, which it saw as a counterbalance to [PRC influence](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China) and a partner in achieving regional security. Singapore had always been an important strategic trading post, giving India trade access to [Maritime Southeast Asia](/wiki/Maritime_Southeast_Asia) and the Far East. Although the rival positions of both nations over the [Vietnam War](/wiki/Vietnam_War) and the [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War) caused consternation between India and Singapore, their relationship expanded significantly in the 1990s; Singapore was one of the first to respond to [India's \"Look East\" Policy](/wiki/Look_East_policy_(India)) of expanding its economic, cultural and strategic ties in Southeast Asia to strengthen its standing as a [regional power](/wiki/Regional_power). Economic and other ties Singapore is the 8th largest source of investment in India and the largest amongst ASEAN member nations. It is also India's 9th biggest trading partner as of 2005–06. Its cumulative investment in India totals US$3 billion as of 2006 and is expected to rise to US 5 billion by 2010 and US 10 billion by 2015. India's economic liberalisation and its \"Look East\" policy have led to a major expansion in bilateral trade, which grew from US$2.2 billion in 2001 to US 9–10 billion in 2006 – a 400% growth in span of five years – and to US$50 billion by 2010. Singapore accounts for 38% of India's trade with ASEAN member nations and 3.4% of its total foreign trade. India's main exports to Singapore in 2005 included petroleum, gemstones, jewellery, machinery and its imports from Singapore included electronic goods, organic chemicals and metals. More than half of Singapore's exports to India are basically \"re-exports\" – items that had been imported from India. [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia)See [Indonesia–Singapore relations](/wiki/Indonesia%E2%80%93Singapore_relations) In August 2005, Singapore and [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to expand aviation rights between the two countries. On 3 October 2005, [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore) [Lee Hsien Loong](/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong) met [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesia) President [Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono](/wiki/Susilo_Bambang_Yudhoyono) in [Bali](/wiki/Bali), just two days after the [Bali bombings](/wiki/2005_Bali_bombings). They agreed to strengthen the fight against terrorism and also discussed cooperation in the fields of economy, trade and investment.[*citation needed*] Relations with Indonesia are generally good, though current outstanding issues include the bans on the export of sand, and [granite](/wiki/Granite); both of which Singapore's construction industry is reliant on. [Iraq](/wiki/Iraq)27 December 1977 - Singapore does not have any diplomatic missions in Iraq. - Iraq is accredited to Singapore via its embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia. [Israel](/wiki/Israel)11 May 1969See [Israel–Singapore relations](/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Singapore_relations) Singapore and Israel enjoy very close bilateral relations. In 1965, Israel extended aid to newly independent Singapore by sending a mission to help build Singapore's economic and defense policy. Israel's representation in Singapore was first formalized in 1968, and relations have since expanded, building strong economic ties and signing bilateral agreements, particularly in areas such as business, technology, healthcare, and defense. Singapore and Israel also hold regular cultural exchanges, through the participation of Israeli arts and artists in Singapore's events, such as the Israeli Film Festival. Despite the close relations, Israel's airline [El Al](/wiki/El_Al) does not fly to Singapore as such a route would have to pass through the airspace of Indonesia and Malaysia, and neither of the countries maintain relations with Israel. - Singapore maintains an honorary consulate in [Tel Aviv](/wiki/Tel_Aviv). - Israel has an embassy in Singapore. [Japan](/wiki/Japan)See [Japan–Singapore relations](/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Singapore_relations). - Japan has an embassy in Singapore. - Singapore has an embassy in [Tokyo](/wiki/Tokyo). [Laos](/wiki/Laos) - Laos has an embassy in Singapore. - Singapore has an embassy in [Vientiane](/wiki/Vientiane). [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia)See [Malaysia–Singapore relations](/wiki/Malaysia%E2%80%93Singapore_relations) Singapore was formerly part of [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) but separated in 1965 due to political differences and racial tension. There remains a high degree of economic and social inter-dependence between the two countries. For example, Singapore imports the vast majority of fresh meat and vegetables from Malaysia, and Malaysia supplies a large fraction of Singapore's fresh water according to two treaties. Many Malaysians work in Singapore, some living in Singapore as permanent residents, while many also commute from [Johor Bahru](/wiki/Johor_Bahru) daily. Bilateral relations are complex and have experienced many highs and lows over the last 40 years. Defence Singapore and Malaysia are both members of the [Five Power Defence Arrangements](/wiki/Five_Power_Defence_Arrangements). The two countries also routinely conduct joint military exercises to enhance bilateral ties and to heighten the professional interaction between the [Singapore Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces) and [Malaysian Armed Forces](/wiki/Malaysian_Armed_Forces). In August 2005, the two countries concluded the 12th exercise of the series, Ex Semangat Bersatu 05 in [Pahang](/wiki/Pahang). Disputes Singapore has several long-standing disputes with [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) over a number of issues. Malaysia and Singapore have clashed over the delivery of fresh water to Singapore, with Malaysia threatening to stop providing water and Singapore threatening to stop relying on Malaysia for water. Others include: - [Maritime boundaries](/wiki/Maritime_boundaries) - Moving of the Singapore station of Malaysia's [Keretapi Tanah Melayu](/wiki/Keretapi_Tanah_Melayu) from Tanjong Pagar to Bukit Timah. See [Malaysia-Singapore Points of Agreement of 1990](/wiki/Malaysia-Singapore_Points_of_Agreement_of_1990) and moving Malaysia's immigration checkpoint from the railway station to the Causeway. This is resolved on 24 May 2010 when Malaysian PM Najib Razak agreed to shift the station and immigration checkpoint from Tanjong Pagar to Woodlands. - Withdrawal of [Central Provident Fund](/wiki/Central_Provident_Fund) funds by West Malaysians. Improved relationship Relations between the two countries has improved in recent years, especially since the transition of leadership in both governments. These relations improved by leaps and bounds when [Abdullah Ahmad Badawi](/wiki/Abdullah_Ahmad_Badawi) took over the post as prime minister. [Mahathir Mohamad](/wiki/Mahathir_Mohamad), the ex-Prime Minister, still raises claims regarding Singapore's intentions in a number of matters, such as [land reclamation](/wiki/Land_reclamation). On 26 April 2005, the two countries signed a settlement agreement concerning Singapore's land reclamation in and around the Straits of Johor. Both countries exchanged many high-level visits in 2004 and 2005, including the visit to Singapore on 12 January 2004 by Malaysian Prime Minister [Abdullah Ahmad Badawi](/wiki/Abdullah_Ahmad_Badawi) who had just taken over from Mahathir in October 2003.

[Myanmar](/wiki/Myanmar)12 April 1966See [Myanmar–Singapore relations](/wiki/Myanmar%E2%80%93Singapore_relations) Myanmar has an embassy in Singapore. Singapore has an embassy in [Yangon](/wiki/Yangon). Singapore is one of Myanmar's top investors and trading partners. In the past, Singapore faced scrutiny from Burmese democracy activists, exacerbated by [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew)'s comments in 1996. After the [2021 Myanmar coup](/wiki/2021_Myanmar_coup), Singapore adopted stronger stances against the military regime and pressuring the regime to cooperate with ASEAN's peace plan. However, Singapore continues to be a major source of equipment for the junta's weapons factories. [North Korea](/wiki/North_Korea)8 November 1975See [North Korea–Singapore relations](/wiki/North_Korea%E2%80%93Singapore_relations) Singapore and North Korea established diplomatic relations on 8 November 1975. North Korea maintains an embassy in Singapore while the latter has accredited a non-resident ambassador to [Pyongyang](/wiki/Pyongyang) from [Beijing](/wiki/Beijing) since 1990.

[Taiwan](/wiki/Taiwan)See [Singapore–Taiwan relations](/wiki/Singapore%E2%80%93Taiwan_relations) During British rule in Singapore and then under British Malaya before independence, Singapore and the Republic of China had diplomatic relations. When Singapore became independent in 1965 from Malaysia, it continued to recognise the [Republic of China](/wiki/Republic_of_China) on Taiwan. When Singapore established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1990, Singapore wanted to maintain its good relationship with Taiwan and it strongly bargained with the PRC to maintain close relations with Taiwan. Both countries have had unofficial relations since the independence of Singapore and establishment of [Republic of China](/wiki/Republic_of_China) rule over the island of Taiwan. Taiwan has a [representative office](/wiki/Taipei_Representative_Office_in_Singapore) in Singapore. Conversely, Singapore is represented by what is known as the [Singapore Trade Office in Taipei](/wiki/Singapore_Trade_Office_in_Taipei) in Taiwan. The two nations have enjoyed an extensive relationship in many facets such as trade and defence, most noticeably being Singapore's establishment of military bases in Taiwan for its troops to conduct overseas training. Like Thailand where Singapore today adopted modern military training bases with, Taiwan was also under Japanese [Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere](/wiki/Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere) influence leading up to post-World War II. Strategically, the [Japanese occupation of Singapore](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore) and the [Japanese occupation of Malaya](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Malaya) was made possible and expedited because of Thai and Taiwanese varied involvements and / or assistances towards the Japanese war efforts. Since the independence of Singapore and the establishment of [Kuomintang](/wiki/Kuomintang) rule over the island of Taiwan, the [Singapore Armed Forces](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces) (SAF) adopted military training bases in Taiwan from 1975 that included combined arms exercises involving infantry, artillery, and armored units. The then prime minister of Singapore [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) also appointed Taiwanese military personnel in training [Republic of Singapore Air Force](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force)[*citation needed*]. These exercises, engaging as many as 10,000 troops at one time, provided officers a chance to [simulate](/wiki/Military_simulation) wartime conditions more closely and gain experience in the command and control of operations involving several [battalions](/wiki/Battalion). With waning Taiwan diplomatic significance, the People's Republic of China has since succeeded the governance of mainland China in the aftermath of the [Chinese Civil War](/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War). Attempts by the 2016 newly elected Taiwanese government in turning to South East Asian nations such as Singapore is subtly deemed as separatist. Agreements In 2010, bilateral trade talks commenced to explore the feasibility of an economic cooperation agreement between the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu ([Republic of China](/wiki/Republic_of_China)) and Singapore, both of whom are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). On 12 September 2012, former Taiwanese Vice-President Lien Chan announced that talks between Taiwan and Singapore on a proposed economic partnership agreement are expected to be finalised by the end of the year. The successful implementation of this economic partnership would mean that both countries will enjoy free trade between one another. CooperationBusiness and trade The Taipei Representative Office in Singapore has been actively promoting trade as well as encouraging mutual start-ups by businesses and enterprises between the two countries. Moreover, in 2009, the Singapore Trade Office in Taipei was honoured for its role in developing close economic ties between the two sides. Taiwan is Singapore's ninth largest trading partner, with bilateral trade topping S$35 billion in 2008. Military When Singapore started building up its military soon after independence, the Republic of China (Taiwan) was one of the few places to offer assistance by providing training areas to the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to conduct military exercises. This was crucial to Singapore as it was a small country which suffered from land-scarcity making it difficult to conduct large-scale military exercises for its soldiers. Since 1975, the Singapore Army has used bases in Taiwan for military training that included combined arms exercises involving infantry, artillery, and armoured units. These exercises, engaging as many as 10,000 troops at one time, provided officers a chance to simulate wartime conditions more closely and gain experience in the command and control of operations involving several battalions. Although China has officially offered Singapore to shift its training facilities to Hainan Island, this has been refused in order to maintain its policy of neutrality between the 'One China' policy and its relations with Taiwan. It also signals that Taiwan-Singapore ties are strong. Controversies Just before Singaporean prime minister Lee Hsien Loong took office from the then incumbent Goh Chok Tong, he made a visit to Taiwan to familiarise himself with the latest developments there. The Taiwanese media, however, made use of this opportunity to publicise his visit with the agenda of highlighting it to [Mainland China](/wiki/Mainland_China). Controversy struck swiftly, with PRC Foreign Ministry spokesperson [Zhang Qiyue](/wiki/Zhang_Qiyue) accusing Lee of \"hurting the feelings of 1.3 billion Chinese\". Meetings and business transactions between Singapore and the PRC were reportedly frozen overnight. As a result, in his maiden National Day Rally speech, Lee criticised the Taiwanese leadership and populace of overestimating the support they would receive if they were to declare Taiwan independence. Later that year in September, Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo cautioned the United Nations General Assembly about the dangers of letting the cross-strait relationship deteriorate. This led to Taiwan's foreign minister, Mark Chen, to famously describe Singapore as a 'nation no bigger than a piece of snot' (鼻屎大ㄟ國家) in Chinese. Supporters of Taiwanese independence also burnt the flag of Singapore as a sign of protest against George Yeo's comments at the United Nations. This did not go down well with the majority of the Singaporean public. These incidents marked an all-time low in foreign relations between the two sides although Chen did make a formal apology later regarding his comments. Issue of Taiwanese independence On 3 October 1990, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Singapore established formal diplomatic relations. Relationship between the two sides has since improved tremendously. . Even so, Singapore has always wanted to maintain its warm ties with Taiwan in order to show its neutrality on cross-strait relations. Although it officially supports the 'One China' policy, Singapore is the only foreign country to currently own military bases in Taiwan and it continues to send its troops there for an annual military exercise known as Exercise Starlight (星光計畫). The PRC has continuously advocated the possibility of moving some or all of these military facilities to [Hainan](/wiki/Hainan), although this may not be taken up due to sensitivities in diplomatic relations between Singapore and her largely Islamic neighbours.

In November 2008, Singapore signed an open skies agreement (OSA) with Romania to allow greater flexibility on air services. In 2000, trade between Romania and Singapore was US$15.5 million, roughly balanced.
