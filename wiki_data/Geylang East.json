  "content": "Subzone of Geylang Planning Area in Central Region, Singapore **Geylang East**, as a planning subzone, covers what is more commonly known as **Eunos**, ([IPA](/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): /ˈjuːnoʊs, -ɒs/ *YOO-nohss* or *-⁠noss*). This is located in [Geylang](/wiki/Geylang) in the [Central Region](/wiki/Central_Region,_Singapore) of [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). The vicinity is served by both [Paya Lebar](/wiki/Paya_Lebar_MRT_station) and [Eunos](/wiki/Eunos_MRT_station) [MRT](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) stations. This area is distinct from the Geylang East Central and estate, which is adjacent to and west of Eunos. \"Eunos\" is also the name given to a street called ***Jalan Eunos*** which spans the area. ## Etymology and History The settlement was originally named **Kampong Melayu**, a large [Malay](/wiki/Malays_in_Singapore) village that used to include [Kampong Ubi](/wiki/Ubi,_Singapore) and [Kaki Bukit](/wiki/Kaki_Bukit,_Singapore) areas. It was later renamed Eunos in honour of its founder, [Mohamed Eunos bin Abdullah](/wiki/Mohamed_Eunos_bin_Abdullah). Eunos was the Chairman and co-founder of the Singapore Malay Union and the first Malay representative of the [Legislative Council](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_Singapore), the then governing body of Singapore. In 1927, he appealed to the government and was granted $700,000 that the Singapore Malay Union used for the purchase of 670 [hectares](/wiki/Hectare) of land, which later became known as **Kampong Melayu**. This land was used to provide a home for Malays who were affected by the building of Singapore’s first airport at [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang_Airport). ## Amenities ### Shopping Malls Geylang East is home to 7 shopping malls, namely: - Paya Lebar Square - Paya Lebar Quarter (PLQ) - SingPost Centre - KINEX - City Plaza - Tanjong Katong Complex - Joo Chiat Complex ## Transportation ### Rail Geylang East is served by two [Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) stations, across two lines, the [East West Line](/wiki/East_West_MRT_line) and the [Circle Line](/wiki/Circle_Line_(Singapore)). The two stations are: - **EW7** [Eunos](/wiki/Eunos_MRT_station) - **EW8** **CC9** [Paya Lebar](/wiki/Paya_Lebar_MRT_station) ### Bus Geylang East also houses the [Eunos Bus Interchange](/wiki/Eunos_Bus_Interchange), which opened in December 1989. The bus interchange is operated by [SBS Transit](/wiki/SBS_Transit) and contains 9 bus routes. This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
