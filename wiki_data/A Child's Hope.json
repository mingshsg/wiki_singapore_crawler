It was aired in 2003 on weekday nights at 5:30pm and ran for 2 series. Scenes were filmed at the [Singapore General Hospital](/wiki/Singapore_General_Hospital) and [National University Hospital](/wiki/National_University_Hospital). The opening theme 为明天 was used for both seasons. ## Story This medical drama focuses on the working and personal lives of the doctors, social workers and trainee nurses in the [paediatric](/wiki/Paediatric) department who care for critically ill children with chronic disease or terminal illness, such as congenital heart diseases and kidney problems. Using the hospital as a backdrop, the drama brings forth the importance of understanding the true needs of these children and their families. The drama also highlights the strain on the doctors, nurses and social workers who have to strike a balance between wanting the best for their patients and making sure that their actions are 'socially correct'. The various heroes and angels in this drama include Dr Huang Junsheng ([Tay Ping Hui](/wiki/Tay_Ping_Hui)), the responsible and committed paediatrician who dedicates too much time at the hospital and as a result neglects his girlfriend; Sunny ([Phyllis Quek](/wiki/Phyllis_Quek)), the social worker who believes in giving her best to care for the patients and their families; and three nursing student interns from a polytechnic. They are the bubbly but muddle-headed, Fan Danmei (Florence Tan), the cool and matured Fang Xiuyue ([Yvonne Lim](/wiki/Yvonne_Lim)) and the mission driven Hong Zhonggeng ([Dasmond Koh](/wiki/Dasmond_Koh)). The cast also features Chen Shucheng, [Huang Biren](/wiki/Huang_Biren), [Chen Huihui](/wiki/Chen_Huihui), [Ivy Lee](/wiki/Ivy_Lee_(actress)), [Huang Yiliang](/wiki/Huang_Yiliang) and many others as family members of the main characters and hospital patients. ## Cast ### Season 1 (2003) #### Main cast - [Tay Ping Hui](/wiki/Tay_Ping_Hui) as Huang Junsheng 黄俊生 - [Phyllis Quek](/wiki/Phyllis_Quek) as Zhang Shanni 张珊霓 - [Yvonne Lim](/wiki/Yvonne_Lim) as Fang Xiuyue 方秀月 - [Florence Tan](/wiki/Florence_Tan) as Fan Danmei 范丹美 - [Dasmond Koh](/wiki/Dasmond_Koh) as Hong Zhonggeng 洪忠耿 - [Chen Shucheng](/wiki/Chen_Shucheng) as Zhang Younian 张有年 #### Other cast CastRole[Hong Huifang](/wiki/Hong_Huifang)Lin Peijin 林佩金Michelle LiowSallyCai Ping KaiGranny[Huang Yiliang](/wiki/Huang_Yiliang)Ding Cheng 丁成 (Uncle Ding)[Huang Biren](/wiki/Huang_Biren)Chen Bimei 陈必梅 (Auntie Ding)[Aloysius Pang](/wiki/Aloysius_Pang)Ding Weiliang 丁伟良[Ivy Lee](/wiki/Ivy_Lee_(actress))Yan Lizhu 颜丽珠[Cavin Soh](/wiki/Cavin_Soh)Fan Danshun 范丹顺 ### Season 2 (2004) #### Main cast CastRole[Li Nanxing](/wiki/Li_Nanxing)Hu Yiming 胡逸名 / Hu Yi Dao 胡一刀 - Also known as Hu Xu Lao (Literally \"Bearded Old Man).
