  "content": "Shopping mall in Bedok, Singapore **Bedok Point** was a four-storey mall (with 2 basement stories) located in the town center of [Bedok](/wiki/Bedok) along New Upper Changi Road, and near [Bedok MRT station](/wiki/Bedok_MRT_station). It was officially opened on 26 April 2011, following a [soft opening](/wiki/Soft_launch) on 16 December 2010. It had a range of shops, entertainment outlets, a bookstore and food outlets. It is now being redeveloped for mixed use, comprising commercial units on the ground floor and residences on the upper floors. ## History Built on the site of the former Bedok and Changi theatres, Bedok Point was completed in late 2010 as the first air-conditioned mall in Bedok until the opening of [Bedok Mall](/wiki/Bedok_Mall) in 2013 at the [Bedok Bus Interchange](/wiki/Bedok_Bus_Interchange) site. It had 76 specialty tenants, including anchors such as [Harvey Norman](/wiki/Harvey_Norman) and mainly restaurants and cafes. In 2011, the mall was divested into Frasers Centrepoint Trust by its developer, Frasers Centrepoint Ltd. Bedok Point ceased operations from 1 July 2022. This is attributed to declining footfall as it faced competition from Bedok Mall and recently opened malls in eastern Singapore. It will be demolished and redeveloped into a mixed-used development named **Sky Eden @ Bedok**. Demolition has already commenced and the new development is slated to be completed in 2025.
