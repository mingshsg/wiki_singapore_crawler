  "content": "Title of port officials **Shahbandar** ([Persian](/wiki/Persian_language): شاه‌بندر, [lit.](/wiki/Literal_translation) '[Harbourmaster](/wiki/Harbourmaster)'), was an official of the ports in [Safavid](/wiki/Safavid) Persia and one also known on other shores of the [Indian Ocean](/wiki/Indian_Ocean). The Shahbandar (Port Master) was in charge of the [traders](/wiki/Merchant) and the collection of [taxes](/wiki/Tax). The office of shahbandar first appeared in Persia, and from there spread throughout the Indian Ocean basin. Later on, having become obsolete for the port towns of Persia, the term shahbandar was now used for the official who represented the interests of the [Turkish](/wiki/Turkic_peoples) merchants operating within Persia. In the [Brunei Sultanate](/wiki/Brunei_Sultanate), *Pengiran Shahbandar* or *Pengiran Indera Mahkota* was the highest honour for a politician, reserved for the royal house family. ## Malacca Sultanate During the era of the [Malacca Sultanate](/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate), the *Shahbandar*, also spelt *Syahbandar*, played a crucial role in managing port affairs. In addition to overseeing traders and collecting taxes from international merchants, the *Shahbandar* was responsible for enforcing [maritime laws](/wiki/Admiralty_law) in accordance with the [*Undang-undang Laut Melaka*](/wiki/Undang-Undang_Laut_Melaka) ([Jawi](/wiki/Jawi_script): اوندڠ٢ لاوت ملاك) (Maritime Laws of Malacca). At the height of the sultanate's power, four *Shahbandars* were appointed, each overseeing specific trading communities within the bustling port of Malacca: - The first *Shahbandar* managed the affairs of [Gujarati](/wiki/Gujarati_people) traders. - The second *Shahbandar* oversaw traders from [Southern India](/wiki/South_India), [Bengal](/wiki/Bengal), [Burma](/wiki/Burma), and [Pasai](/wiki/Samudera_Pasai_Sultanate). - The third *Shahbandar* was responsible for traders from [Maritime Southeast Asia](/wiki/Maritime_Southeast_Asia). - The fourth *Shahbandar* handled traders from [Annam](/wiki/Vietnam), [China](/wiki/China), and the [Ryukyu Islands](/wiki/Ryukyu_Islands). In the [Malay nobility](/wiki/Malay_nobility) system, the *Shahbandar* held ranks below the *[Laksamana](/wiki/Laksamana)* (admiral) and the *[Temenggung](/wiki/Temenggong)* (chief of public security). They were part of the *Pembesar Berlapan* (ڤمبسر برلاڤن), one of the tiers within the *Pembesar Empat Lipatan* (ڤمبسر امڤت ليڤتن), the hierarchical structure of Malacca’s nobility. - [Shahbandar (Pakistan)](/wiki/Shahbandar_(Pakistan)) - Raymond, A. & Hooker, M.B.
