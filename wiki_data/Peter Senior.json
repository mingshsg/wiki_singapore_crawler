  "content": "Australian professional golfer (born 1959) **Peter Albert Charles Senior** [OAM](/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia) (born 31 July 1959) is an Australian [professional golfer](/wiki/Professional_golfer) who has won more than twenty tournaments around the world. Senior has competed mainly on the [PGA Tour of Australasia](/wiki/PGA_Tour_of_Australasia), where he has had the most success and won the Order of Merit on four occasions, and the [European Tour](/wiki/European_Tour). He has also played occasionally on the [Japan Golf Tour](/wiki/Japan_Golf_Tour) and the United States–based [PGA Tour](/wiki/PGA_Tour). Senior has represented Australia in international competitions several times, and was a member of the International Team at the first two stagings of the [Presidents Cup](/wiki/Presidents_Cup). He has also represented Australia twice at the World Cup. ## Early life In 1959, Senior was born in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). ## Professional career In 1978, Senior turned professional. He joined the [PGA Tour of Australasia](/wiki/PGA_Tour_of_Australasia) shortly thereafter. During his career, he has won 21 tournaments on the tour, including the [Australian PGA Championship](/wiki/Australian_PGA_Championship) in 1989, 2003 and 2010, the [Australian Open](/wiki/Australian_Open_(golf)) in 1989 and 2012, and the [Australian Masters](/wiki/Australian_Masters) in 1991, 1995, and 2015. Senior has won professional events on the main men's tour in five separate decades, a feat achieved by very few players previously anywhere in the world. He also has the distinction of winning the Australian PGA, Open and Masters tournaments after he turned 50. He also topped the tour's Order of Merit in 1987, 1989 and 1993. Even after reaching the age of fifty, he remained competitive on the tour, through until his retirement from golf in 2016. Between 1984 and 1992, Senior competed on the European Tour full-time, winning four tournaments and finishing a career best of 7th on the Order of Merit in 1987. He also played regularly on the Japanese Tour, winning three tournaments before rejoining the European Tour in 1998. Through the 2007 season he continued to play in a small number of tournaments on the tour. In 1985, Senior finished 5th at the [PGA Tour](/wiki/PGA_Tour) [Qualifying Tournament](/wiki/Qualifying_school) to earn his card for the following season. He did not have much success, making just two cuts in the first half of the season, before he elected to return to Europe. He did play in several PGA Tour events in other seasons, notably finishing tied for second in [The International](/wiki/The_International_(golf)) in 1990, but never tried to qualify for the tour again. Senior made his debut on the over-50 circuit the [Champions Tour](/wiki/Champions_Tour) in February 2010 at [The ACE Group Classic](/wiki/The_ACE_Group_Classic). Senior has yet to win on the [Champions Tour](/wiki/Champions_Tour), but has finished as a runner up on six occasions, with three playoff defeats. One of these came in February 2012 at the [Allianz Championship](/wiki/Allianz_Championship), when Senior birdied the final hole of regulation to make the playoff before losing to [Corey Pavin](/wiki/Corey_Pavin) with a birdie on the first playoff hole. Senior announced his retirement during the second round of the 2016 [Australian Open](/wiki/Australian_Open_(golf)) held at The Royal Sydney Golf Club. Senior suffered a hip injury on the sixth hole and announced his retirement from professional golf shortly after. ## Personal life He lives in [Hope Island, Queensland](/wiki/Hope_Island,_Queensland), with his wife June, whom he married in 1984. They have three children: Krystlle, Jasmine and Mitchell. ## Awards and honors - Senior won the [PGA Tour of Australasia](/wiki/PGA_Tour_of_Australasia)'s Order of Merit four times: in 1987, 1989, 1993, and 2012 - In 1993, Senior was the [PGA Tour of Australasia](/wiki/PGA_Tour_of_Australasia)'s Player of the Year - In 2024, Senior was awarded the [Medal of the Order of Australia](/wiki/Order_of_Australia) in the [2024 King's Birthday Honours](/wiki/2024_King%27s_Birthday_Honours_(Australia)) for his service to golf ## Professional wins (35) ### European Tour wins
