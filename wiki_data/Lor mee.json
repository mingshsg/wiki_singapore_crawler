Variants of the dish are also eaten by [Hokkiens](/wiki/Hokkien_people) ([Min Nan](/wiki/Min_Nan) speakers) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [Thailand](/wiki/Thailand). In the [Philippines](/wiki/Philippines), the local variant is called [lomi](/wiki/Lomi) or pancit lomi. The thick gravy is made of [corn starch](/wiki/Corn_starch), [spices](/wiki/Spice), meat, seafoods and [eggs](/wiki/Egg_(food)). The ingredients added into the noodles are usually [ngo hiang](/wiki/Ngo_hiang), [fish cake](/wiki/Fish_cake), fish, round and flat meat dumplings (usually chicken or pork), half a boiled egg, and other items depending on the stall and the price paid. [Vinegar](/wiki/Vinegar) and garlic can be added as an optional item. Lor mee can be served together with red chili. Traditional versions also include bits of fried fish as topping though few stalls serve this version anymore. In [Putian cuisine](/wiki/Putian_cuisine), lor mee is a much lighter dish usually prepared with less starch and seafood instead of meat. ## Henan lumian In central China's [Henan cuisine](/wiki/Henan_cuisine), the same characters ([Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 河南卤面; [pinyin](/wiki/Pinyin): *Hénán lǔmiàn*) are used for an unrelated dish of wheat noodles traditionally prepared with a labor-intensive process of steaming, stir-frying and then steaming again. Although they are all thought to have descended from lor mee (卤面), a staple of Fujianese cooking. - Food portal - China portal - Indonesia portal - Malaysia portal - Philippines portal - Singapore portal - Thailand portal - [Mie kuah](/wiki/Mie_kuah) - [Chinese Indonesian cuisine](/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian_cuisine) - [Chinese Filipino cuisine](/wiki/Chinese_Filipino_cuisine) - [Hokkien mee](/wiki/Hokkien_mee), a series of Singaporean and Malaysian noodle dishes descended from Fujian lor mee - [Malaysian cuisine](/wiki/Malaysian_cuisine) - [Singaporean cuisine](/wiki/Singaporean_cuisine) - [Thai cuisine](/wiki/Thai_cuisine) This [Singaporean cuisine](/wiki/Singaporean_cuisine)-related article is a stub.
