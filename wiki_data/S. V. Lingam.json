Lingam is a Singaporean politician who had served as a Member of Parliament representing [Aljunied Constituency](/wiki/Aljunied_Constituency) from 1959-1968. He was a member of the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP). ## Early life and career Born in Singapore, Lingam was educated at [Victoria School](/wiki/Victoria_School). ## Political career Lingam was a central executive committee member of the People's Action Party. Lingam was expelled from the PAP alongside Ng Teng Kian and [Ong Eng Guan](/wiki/Ong_Eng_Guan) in July 1960. With Ong, he co-founded [United People's Party](/wiki/United_People%27s_Party_(Singapore)) and became its treasurer. In August 1962, Lingam resigned from UPP. He rejoined the PAP, and was re-elected in the 1963 elections, before standing down in the 1968 election. Lee Kuan Yew, in the chapter 27 of the first volume of his memoirs, *The Singapore Story*, said Goh Keng Swee learnt, after Singapore's merger with Malaysia, that Lingam had been a paid agent of the Malayan Special Branch, spying on Ong Eng Guan, before being directed to return to the PAP when it looked like Lee's government was in danger of collapse in 1962. PAP then dropped Lingam as a candidate in the 1968 election.
