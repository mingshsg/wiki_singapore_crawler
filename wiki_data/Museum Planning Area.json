  "content": "Planning Area in Central Region, Singapore The **Museum Planning Area** is a [planning area](/wiki/Planning_Areas_of_Singapore) located in the [Central Area](/wiki/Central_Area,_Singapore) of the [Central Region](/wiki/Central_Region,_Singapore) of Singapore. The area plays a \"bridging role\" between the [Orchard](/wiki/Orchard_Road) area and the [Downtown Core](/wiki/Downtown_Core), which necessitates proper transport networks for vehicles, pedestrians and public transport. Due to the sheer size of green areas in the district, the [Urban Redevelopment Authority](/wiki/Urban_Redevelopment_Authority) (URA) has designated it a 'green lung' in the Central Area. However, the Museum Planning Area is also home to cultural and commercial activities. Around 65% of the area is available for future development, making it a hotbed for new infrastructure and buildings. Museum planning area is bounded by the planning areas of [Newton](/wiki/Newton,_Singapore) and [Rochor](/wiki/Rochor) to the north, the [Downtown Core](/wiki/Downtown_Core) to the southeast, [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River) to the south, [River Valley](/wiki/River_Valley,_Singapore) to the west and [Orchard](/wiki/Orchard,_Singapore) to the northwest. It is divided itself into three subzones, [Bras Basah](/wiki/Bras_Basah), [Dhoby Ghaut](/wiki/Dhoby_Ghaut) and Fort Canning, home to [Fort Canning Hill](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Hill). ## History Ten [national monuments](/wiki/National_Monuments_of_Singapore) are located within the Museum Planning Area, namely the [Armenian Church](/wiki/Armenian_Church,_Singapore), the [Cathedral of the Good Shepherd](/wiki/Cathedral_of_the_Good_Shepherd), [Cathay Building](/wiki/Cathay_Building) (now [The Cathay](/wiki/The_Cathay)), the [Central Fire Station](/wiki/Central_Fire_Station,_Singapore), the [House of Tan Yeok Nee](/wiki/House_of_Tan_Yeok_Nee), the [MacDonald House](/wiki/MacDonald_House), the [Old Tao Nan School](/wiki/Old_Tao_Nan_School) ([Peranakan Museum](/wiki/Peranakan_Museum)), the [National Museum of Singapore](/wiki/National_Museum_of_Singapore), the [Old Hill Street Police Station](/wiki/Old_Hill_Street_Police_Station) and the [Singapore Art Museum](/wiki/Singapore_Art_Museum)/[Former Saint Joseph's Institution](/wiki/Former_Saint_Joseph%27s_Institution). The area is home to significant events such as the [Battle of Singapore](/wiki/Battle_of_Singapore) and [MacDonald House bombing](/wiki/MacDonald_House_bombing). Other historical sites include: - [YMCA Building](/wiki/Kenpeitai_East_District_Branch) - [National Theatre](/wiki/National_Theatre,_Singapore) - United Chinese Library ## Geography The Museum Planning Area is bordered by [Rochor](/wiki/Rochor) to the northeast, the [Downtown Core](/wiki/Downtown_Core) to the southeast, the [Singapore River Area](/wiki/Singapore_River_Planning_Area) to the southwest, [River Valley](/wiki/River_Valley,_Singapore) to the west and [Newton](/wiki/Newton,_Singapore) and [Orchard](/wiki/Orchard_Road) to the northwest. The area is roughly bounded by [Hill Street](/wiki/Hill_Street,_Singapore), [River Valley Road](/wiki/River_Valley,_Singapore), Clemenceau Avenue and [Bras Basah Road](/wiki/Bras_Basah_Road). It is the smallest urban planning area, with an area of 83 hectares. Parks and [open spaces](/wiki/Public_space) take up a third of the area of the Museum Planning Area, and include [Fort Canning](/wiki/Fort_Canning), [Istana Park](/wiki/Istana_Park) and Bras Basah Park, which can be used for [recreational](/wiki/Recreation) purposes. Collectively, these places will form the so-called 'green lung' of the Central Area. [Terraces](/wiki/Terrace_(building)) have been proposed to allow for \"a more prominent and convenient access\" to the Fort Canning area. ## Institutions The Museum Planning Area is Singapore's \"[institutional](/wiki/Institution) hub\", with 11% of land set aside for institutional use and reserve sites to be safeguarded for future institutions. The [Registry of Marriages](/wiki/Registry_of_Marriages) and the sprawling [Singapore Management University](/wiki/Singapore_Management_University) campus are located in the area. The many museums in the area, which give the Museum District its name, include the [Singapore Art Museum](/wiki/Singapore_Art_Museum), the [National Archives of Singapore](/wiki/National_Archives_of_Singapore), the [Children's Museum (formerly the Singapore Philatelic Museum)](/wiki/Children%27s_Museum_Singapore), the [Peranakan Museum](/wiki/Peranakan_Museum), the [Civil Defence Heritage Gallery](/wiki/Civil_Defence_Heritage_Gallery) (at the site of the [Central Fire Station](/wiki/Central_Fire_Station,_Singapore)), National Heritage Gallery and the Armenian Heritage Gallery are all here. The [National Library](/wiki/National_Library,_Singapore), the flagship library of the [National Library Board](/wiki/National_Library_Board), is also located here. The [National Gallery](/wiki/National_Gallery_Singapore), [National Museum of Singapore](/wiki/National_Museum_of_Singapore) and the [Asian Civilisations Museum](/wiki/Asian_Civilisations_Museum) are in the neighbouring City Hall, [Downtown Core planning area](/wiki/Downtown_Core). The arts scene is vibrant in the area, with [The Substation](/wiki/The_Substation), the [Singapore Calligraphy Centre](/wiki/Singapore_Calligraphy_Centre), the YMS Arts Centre and the Singapore Dance Ensemble all located within its boundaries. All the major arts schools in Singapore are also located in Bras Basah: the first pre-tertiary arts school, [School of the Arts (SOTA)](/wiki/School_of_the_Arts,_Singapore), and also the two institutions that form the [University of the Arts](/wiki/University_of_the_Arts_Singapore): [LASALLE College of the Arts](/wiki/Lasalle_College_of_the_Arts) and [Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA)](/wiki/Nanyang_Academy_of_Fine_Arts). Two buildings here, both designed by local firm WOHA, have also been awarded at the [World Architecture Festival](/wiki/World_Architecture_Festival): SOTA, in 2010 in the *learning* category, and [Bras Basah MRT station](/wiki/Bras_Basah_MRT_station), a [Mass Rapid Transit](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) (MRT) station on the [Circle line (CCL)](/wiki/Circle_Line_(Singapore)), in 2009 in the *transport* category. Scattered within the area and in neighbouring areas are [places of worship](/wiki/Place_of_worship) such as churches, mosques, [Hindu temples](/wiki/Hindu_temple) and synagogues. Like [Telok Ayer Street](/wiki/Telok_Ayer_Street), it also features them in close proximity to each other: along Waterloo Street and its preluding path there stand the [Buddhist](/wiki/Buddhism) [Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple](/wiki/Kwan_Im_Thong_Hood_Cho_Temple), the [Hindu](/wiki/Hinduism) [Sri Krishnan Temple](/wiki/Sri_Krishnan_Temple), the [Jewish](/wiki/Jews) [Maghain Aboth synagogue](/wiki/Maghain_Aboth_Synagogue) and the [Catholic](/wiki/Catholic_Church) [Church of Saints Peter & Paul](/wiki/Church_of_Saints_Peter_and_Paul,_Singapore). The oldest surviving church in Singapore, the [Armenian Church of St. Gregory the Illuminator](/wiki/Armenian_Church,_Singapore) (est. 1835) and the Bible House are present in the Museum planning area. The second-oldest surviving church, [St. Andrew's Cathedral](/wiki/St_Andrew%27s_Cathedral,_Singapore) (est. 1836), is in the neighbouring City Hall, [Downtown Core planning area](/wiki/Downtown_Core). ## Residential development Despite its prime location, [residential](/wiki/Residential_area) projects were only allocated 1% of the land area, and the Museum Planning Area was criticised for lacking residential zoning. Due to the lack of residents, there were fears that the area would become a \"[ghost town](/wiki/Ghost_town)\" at night. Furthermore, the concept of living within the Central Area had gained popularity, and up-market skyscraper [condominiums](/wiki/Condominium_(living_space)) could be built. The greenery of the Museum Planning Area could provide a peaceful environment for living. The URA replied that several plots of land had been sold for residential-commercial mixed use, and that more housing developments were to be planned and constructed. The URA emphasised the importance of the area as a transition between the central business district and shopping areas, as well as the green, pedestrian-friendly nature of the URA's plan for the area. ## Commercial development The Museum Planning Area is home to various shopping malls, including Park Mall, [Plaza Singapura](/wiki/Plaza_Singapura), [The Cathay](/wiki/The_Cathay), Singapore Shopping Centre and The Atrium @ Orchard. More vacant land will be set aside for commercial uses, especially around [Dhoby Ghaut MRT station](/wiki/Dhoby_Ghaut_MRT_station) and [Bras Basah MRT station](/wiki/Bras_Basah_MRT_station). These will be properly integrated and connected with the respective stations. Hotels in the area include Bayview Hotel Singapore and Hotel Rendezvous. Furthermore, a hotel development at the foot of Fort Canning Hill near the junction of Clemenceau Avenue and [River Valley Road](/wiki/River_Valley,_Singapore) is in the planning stages, and is meant to be a retreat from urban living \"amidst lush greenery\". Other developments are planned on reserved sites near Fort Canning, but details have not been released. ## Transport The Museum Planning Area is served by four [Mass Rapid Transit](/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)) (MRT) stations: [Dhoby Ghaut](/wiki/Dhoby_Ghaut_MRT_station), [Bras Basah](/wiki/Bras_Basah_MRT_station), [Fort Canning](/wiki/Fort_Canning_MRT_station) and [Bencoolen](/wiki/Bencoolen_MRT_station). The [North–South Line](/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_Line_(Singapore)) and the [North East Line](/wiki/North_East_Line) can only be accessible from Dhoby Ghaut while the [Circle Line](/wiki/Circle_Line_(Singapore)) can be accessible from both Dhoby Ghaut and Bras Basah, while the [Downtown Line](/wiki/Downtown_Line) is accessible from Fort Canning and Bencoolen. The [Central Expressway's](/wiki/Central_Expressway,_Singapore) [Chin Swee Tunnel](/wiki/Chin_Swee_Tunnel) also passes under the area. ### Roads #### Improvements Several changes to the road network in the area will be implemented, including the construction of [Fort Canning Tunnel](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Tunnel) and the realignment of [Stamford Road](/wiki/Stamford_Road) and Handy Road. The rationale for the improvements is increased traffic from [Marina Centre](/wiki/Marina_Centre) and relieving the [traffic congestion](/wiki/Traffic_congestion) along [Orchard Road](/wiki/Orchard_Road). Furthermore, a new road network has been put in place to ensure smooth traffic flow after the full development of land around the MRT Stations. #### Major roads - [Armenian Street](/wiki/Armenian_Street,_Singapore) - [Bras Basah Road](/wiki/Bras_Basah_Road) - [Central Expressway](/wiki/Central_Expressway,_Singapore) - Clemenceau Avenue - [Fort Canning Tunnel](/wiki/Fort_Canning_Tunnel) - [Hill Street](/wiki/Hill_Street,_Singapore) - [Orchard Road](/wiki/Orchard_Road) - [Queen Street](/wiki/Queen_Street,_Singapore) - [River Valley Road](/wiki/River_Valley,_Singapore) - [Stamford Road](/wiki/Stamford_Road) - [Victoria Street](/wiki/Victoria_Street,_Singapore) ### Pedestrian linkages The [Development Guide Plan](/wiki/Development_Guide_Plan) for the Museum Planning Area envisages \"a comprehensive pedestrian network linking developments, parks and open spaces\". New [promenades](/wiki/Esplanade) and [pedestrian malls](/wiki/Pedestrian_malls) are planned for the area to enhance and connect existing [sidewalks](/wiki/Sidewalk). A web of [underpasses](/wiki/Tunnel) and covered walkways will link [Orchard](/wiki/Orchard_Road), the [Singapore River](/wiki/Singapore_River), [Raffles City](/wiki/Raffles_City_Singapore) and [Marina Centre](/wiki/Marina_Centre). 1. \"Museum Planning Area – An Institutional Hub\". *[Development Guide Plans](/wiki/Development_Guide_Plan)*.
