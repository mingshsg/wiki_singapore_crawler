  "content": "The **[Republic of Singapore](/wiki/Singapore)** officially became the 117th member of the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations) (UN) after its independence on August 9, 1965. From 2001 to 2002, Singapore held a rotational seat on the [United Nations Security Council](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council) and has participated in UN peacekeeping/observer missions in [Kuwait](/wiki/Kuwait), [Angola](/wiki/Angola), [Kenya](/wiki/Kenya), [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia) and [Timor Leste](/wiki/Timor_Leste). ## History Before independence, Singapore had [merged](/wiki/Singapore_in_Malaysia) with the [Federation of Malaya](/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya) with [North Borneo](/wiki/North_Borneo) and [Sarawak](/wiki/Crown_Colony_of_Sarawak) to form [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) on August 31, 1963 and at that time, the Federation of Malaya was already a member of the UN. Due to distrust and ideological differences between leaders of the [State of Singapore](/wiki/Singapore_in_Malaysia) and the federal government of Malaysia, Singapore became an independent state about 2 years after the union, on August 9, 1965. [Requirements](/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations) for joining the United Nations under the [UN Charter](/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations) of the time required sponsorship by minimum of 2 members on the United Nations Security Council, support from the members on the council and about 67% of the votes during the [United Nations General Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly) to be successfully admitted into the organisation. After independence, Singapore applied to join the UN on September 2, 1965 with the sponsorship of Malaysia, the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom), [Ivory Coast](/wiki/Ivory_Coast) and [Jordan](/wiki/Jordan). On September 20, 1965, Singapore's admission to the UN was put into vote in the security council and the result of the vote was unanimous. Singapore was then officially registered as a member of the UN on September 21, 1965, with Abu Bakar bin Pawanchee serving as the first permanent representative to the UN. In 1969, the United Nations Association of Singapore was set up as part of the [World Federation of United Nations Associations](/wiki/World_Federation_of_United_Nations_Associations), which is part of 'The Third United Nations'. Since then, Singapore has been actively participating in UN peacekeeping operations. In 1997, the country became only the seventh country to sign the Memorandum of Understanding on UN Standby Arrangements. ## Activities ### Security Council During the [2000 United Nations Security Council election](/wiki/2000_United_Nations_Security_Council_election), Singapore was elected as one of the five non-permanent members of the [UN Security Council](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council) and served a two-year term from 2001 to 2002. In January 2001 and May 2002, Ambassador [Kishore Mahbubani](/wiki/Kishore_Mahbubani), the permanent representative of Singapore then, served as the [President of the United Nations Security Council](/wiki/President_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council) together with Ambassador [S. Jayakumar](/wiki/S._Jayakumar_(Singaporean_politician)). During Singapore's time on the security council, it managed to lobbied for a time extension for the [United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor](/wiki/United_Nations_Transitional_Administration_in_East_Timor) until East Timor's independence, despite objection from a permanent member on the council. ### Peacekeeping and observer missions Since 1989, Singapore has taken part in 17 peacekeeping and observer missions with personnel from the [Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)](/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces) and [Singapore Police Force (SPF)](/wiki/Singapore_Police_Force).

A total of 30 personnel from the SPF was sent on the mission and the country also contributed [S$](/wiki/Singapore_dollar)172,652 to the operations of the [United Nations Transition Assistance Group](/wiki/United_Nations_Transition_Assistance_Group).

The main functionality of the software is to allow the reporting of casualty for personnel serving in peacekeeping operations, which will be then accessed by authorized users in the UN Headquarters in New York, and all Peacekeeping and Special Political Missions. The tool was developed by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), the [UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (UN DPKO)](/wiki/United_Nations_Department_of_Peace_Operations) and the [UN Department of Field Support (UN DFS)](/wiki/United_Nations_Department_of_Field_Support) and was launched in May 2017. The launch of the software was officiated by [Jean-Pierre Lacroix](/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Lacroix_(diplomat)), the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations in a ceremony in New York. ## Representation Singapore maintains 3 permanent missions to the UN and 1 permanent delegate to [UNESCO](/wiki/UNESCO).
