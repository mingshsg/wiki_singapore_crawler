  "content": "Museum in Singapore The **Singapore Sports Museum** is a sports [museum](/wiki/Museum) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), located at the [Singapore Sports Hub](/wiki/Singapore_Sports_Hub) in [Kallang](/wiki/Kallang). The Singapore Sports Museum is affiliated to the International Association of Sports Museums and Hall of Fame (IASMHF) based in the United States since 1984. It is also a member of the Museum Roundtable, set up by the [National Heritage Board](/wiki/National_Heritage_Board_(Singapore)). ## History The Singapore Sports Museum was established in 1983 at the [former National Stadium](/wiki/Former_National_Stadium,_Singapore) to preserve and showcase Singapore's sporting heritage. It was opened to the public in May 1983 to coincide with the staging of the [1983 Southeast Asian Games](/wiki/1983_Southeast_Asian_Games) in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore). In 2007, its collection was temporarily moved to the [Singapore Sports Council](/wiki/Singapore_Sports_Council)'s (SSC) temporary office and heritage corners of selected SSC sports and recreation centres such as Jurong West and [Sengkang](/wiki/Sengkang_Sports_Complex), while a new iteration of the museum was constructed as part of the Singapore Sports Hub project, originally expected to be completed by 2011. The rebuilt museum reopened on 6 October 2014, which added new interactive exhibits, an exhibit paying tribute to the former National Stadium, and a new Singapore [Youth Olympic](/wiki/Youth_Olympic_Games) Museum. ## Galleries In total, there were 6 galleries.
