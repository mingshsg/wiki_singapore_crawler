Established under the [Rendel Constitution](/wiki/Rendel_Constitution), it marked a significant shift toward representative government, with a majority of its members elected by the public. The Assembly underwent constitutional reforms in 1958 to provide for full internal self-government, and it functioned as the legislature of the State of Singapore until the country's full independence in 1965. It was then succeeded by the [Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore), which continues to serve as the country's legislative authority. ## Overview The Rendel Constitution first came into effect following the [1955 general election](/wiki/1955_Singaporean_general_election), marking a significant step in Singapore's constitutional development. It replaced the [Legislative Council](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_Singapore), featuring a substantial increase in elected representation. Of the 32 seats in the Legislative Assembly, 25 were filled through direct elections, while the remaining 7 were appointed by the British colonial administration. This marked a shift from the previous structure, in which most members were nominated rather than elected. Despite this move toward greater self-governance, the British retained considerable authority, including the power of [veto](/wiki/Veto) and control over key areas such as internal security, foreign affairs and defence. ## History Ongoing political agitation for greater [self-governance](/wiki/Self-governance_of_Singapore) in Singapore intensified during the 1950s. Chief Minister [David Marshall](/wiki/David_Marshall_(Singaporean_politician)), who led the [Labour Front](/wiki/Labour_Front) government formed after the [1955 general election](/wiki/1955_Singaporean_general_election), initiated constitutional talks with the British government in 1956. However, his first delegation to [London](/wiki/London) failed to secure full internal self-government due to concerns over Singapore's political stability and public order. Marshall resigned following this failure, as he had pledged to do if the mission was unsuccessful. His successor, [Lim Yew Hock](/wiki/Lim_Yew_Hock), adopted a more hardline approach to internal security and took action against [left-wing](/wiki/Left-wing) [trade unions](/wiki/Trade_unions) and pro-communist elements, measures that reassured the British authorities of Singapore's administrative capability. Under Lim's leadership, renewed negotiations with the British culminated in the 1958 Constitutional Agreement, formally known as the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council 1958. This agreement led to amendments to the Constitution, providing for a fully elected Legislative Assembly with 51 seats and granting the colony full internal self-government, except in the areas of defence and foreign affairs, which remained under British control. The new constitutional framework took effect after the [1959 general election](/wiki/1959_Singaporean_general_election), in which the [People's Action Party](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party) (PAP) won a decisive victory. This marked the beginning of self-governing rule under [Lee Kuan Yew](/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) with the newly created position of [Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore). The Legislative Assembly, now operating with significantly expanded powers, functioned as the primary law-making body of the state. Following [Singapore's separation from Malaysia](/wiki/Independence_of_Singapore_Agreement_1965) and the declaration of independence on 9 August 1965, the Legislative Assembly was formally reconstituted as the [Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore) under the country's new constitutional framework. The existing members of the Assembly became the first Members of Parliament (MPs), ensuring institutional continuity as a newly sovereign nation. ## List of sessions Legislative AssemblyCommencedSessionSession datesDissolvedBy-elections1st ((/wiki/1955_Singaporean_general_election))22 April 19551st22 April 1955 – 7 June 195631 March 1959(/wiki/1957_Singaporean_by-elections)2nd29 August 1956 – 8 January 19583rd9 April 1958 – 19 March 19592nd ((/wiki/1959_Singaporean_general_election))1 July 19591st1 July 1959 – 1 June 19603 September 19631961 ([April](/wiki/1961_Singaporean_by-elections#April_1961_by-election_in_Hong_Lim), [July](/wiki/1961_Singaporean_by-elections#July_1961_by-election_in_Anson))2nd20 July 1960 – 20 July 19613rd31 October 1961 – 13 July 19624th27 March 1963 – 1 August 19633rd ((/wiki/1963_Singaporean_general_election))22 October 19631st22 October 1963 – 16 June 19657 December August 1965 (Disbanded)(/wiki/1965_Hong_Lim_by-election) - [Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_the_Straits_Settlements) - [Legislative Council of Singapore](/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_Singapore) - [Parliament of Singapore](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore)\n",
