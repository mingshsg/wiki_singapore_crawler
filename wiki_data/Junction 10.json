It is owned by [Far East Organization](/wiki/Far_East_Organization). It was accessible via the then-operational [Ten Mile Junction LRT station](/wiki/Ten_Mile_Junction_LRT_station), on the [Bukit Panjang LRT line](/wiki/Bukit_Panjang_LRT_line), which has been permanently closed since 13 January 2019. The platform was located on level 3 of the complex, which also houses the [Ten Mile Junction Depot](/wiki/Ten_Mile_Junction_Depot) adjacent to the station. The shopping mall was closed on 10 December 2010 and reopened on 30 December 2011 as **Junction 10**. It is stylized as JUNCT10N, similar to [Junction 8](/wiki/Junction_8) in Bishan. After reopening, Junction 10 became a [mixed-use development](/wiki/Mixed-use_development), together with The Tennery, a [private housing estate](/wiki/Private_housing_estate) occupying levels 4 and above. They consists of 338 innovative [SOHO](/wiki/SoHo,_Manhattan)-style [loft](/wiki/Loft) apartments with a variety of [recreational facilities](/wiki/Recreational_activities) such as open-air [swimming pools](/wiki/Swimming_pool) and [tennis courts](/wiki/Tennis_court). It is currently anchored by Mindchamps Preschool, [Fitness First](/wiki/Fitness_First) (formerly [Celebrity Fitness](/wiki/Celebrity_Fitness)), and [Sheng Siong](/wiki/Sheng_Siong_Supermarket) (formerly occupied by [Giant Hypermarket](/wiki/Giant_Hypermarket)).
