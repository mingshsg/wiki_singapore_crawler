  "content": "Bridge in Bukit Merah, Singapore The **Keppel Bay Bridge** ([Chinese](/wiki/Simplified_Chinese): 吉宝湾桥, [Malay](/wiki/Malay_language): *Jambatan Teluk Keppel*) is the longest cable-stayed bridge in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) along Keppel Bay Vista, spanning 250 metres across the strait linking the private [Keppel Island](/wiki/Keppel_Island,_Singapore) to mainland. The bridge was officially opened on 3 January 2008 by the sixth [President of Singapore](/wiki/President_of_Singapore) [S. R. Nathan](/wiki/S._R._Nathan). Built at a cost of $30 million, the cable-stayed bridge allows currents to flow freely through the marina basin, bringing in nutrients, plankton and marine larvae, while helping to remove sediment that would otherwise settle on marine organisms and smother them. 1°15′50.58″N 103°48′50.94″E﻿ / ﻿1.2640500°N 103.8141500°E﻿ / 1.2640500; 103.8141500 This [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore) location article is a stub.
