The games' first gold medal was also won by the **[Singapore](/wiki/Singapore)** water polo team. ## Expectations Singapore entered the games with no official medal targets, but local media the [Straits Times](/wiki/Straits_Times) predicted 30 gold medals. The target is set lower than that for the previous games, as sports where Singapore traditionally does well, such as sailing, gymnastics and bowling were not featured in the games. More specific targets were set by some sports, including swimming (11 golds), shooting (4 golds), football (1 gold), table tennis (7 golds) and water polo (1 gold). While no medals are expected, boxing, a sport Singapore is deputing in, aims to reach the semi-finals. ## Medals **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(July 2010)* This [Asian Games](/wiki/Asian_Games) article is a stub.
