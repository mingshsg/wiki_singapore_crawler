  "content": "The [President of Singapore](/wiki/President_of_Singapore) is the [head of state](/wiki/Head_of_state) of the [Republic of Singapore](/wiki/Republic_of_Singapore). Preceded by the [Yang di-Pertuan Negara](/wiki/Yang_di-Pertuan_Negara), the office of president was created on 22 December 1965 after [Singapore's independence in August 1965](/wiki/Independence_of_Singapore_Agreement_1965), with Yang di-Pertuan Negara [Yusof Ishak](/wiki/Yusof_Ishak) serving as the first president. Under the [Constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Singapore), presidents must be a [Singaporean citizen](/wiki/Singaporean_nationality_law), [non-partisan](/wiki/Non-partisan_democracy), and elected by a [popular vote](/wiki/Popular_vote). Originally elected by [Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore), a 1991 [constitutional amendment](/wiki/Constitutional_amendment) was made to allow for the president to be [directly elected](/wiki/Presidential_elections_in_Singapore) by a popular vote, with the [1993 presidential election](/wiki/1993_Singaporean_presidential_election) between [Ong Teng Cheong](/wiki/Ong_Teng_Cheong) and [Chua Kim Yeow](/wiki/Chua_Kim_Yeow) being the first time a president was directly elected by popular vote. Singapore follows a [non-executive model](/wiki/Head_of_state#Non-executive_model) of the [Westminster](/wiki/Westminster_system) [parliamentary system](/wiki/Parliamentary_system) where the president serves as the head of state, separate to the [head of government](/wiki/Head_of_government) which is instead served by the [Cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Singapore), led by the [prime minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore). In 2016, a second constitutional amendment was made that allowed for a presidential election to be reserved for an [ethnic community in Singapore](/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore) if no one from that community had served as president for the last five presidential terms. The role of the president was originally ceremonial and symbolic, carrying residual powers, however the [role was later given executive powers](/wiki/Powers_of_the_president_of_Singapore) such as the [reserve power](/wiki/Reserve_power) to [veto](/wiki/Veto) certain [bills](/wiki/Act_of_Parliament#Bills), most notably in relation to Singapore's [reserves](/wiki/Reserves_of_the_Government_of_Singapore) as a [check and balance](/wiki/Check_and_balance) process as well as revoking and appointing public service appointments among other powers listed in the Constitution. The president also represents the country at official diplomatic functions, with a 2023 constitutional amendment allowing the president to take up appointments internationally which are of interest of Singapore. There have been nine presidents since Singapore gained independence in 1965. The term of president was previously 4 years, with it being extended to 6 years following the 1991 constitutional amendment. Two presidents, [Yusof Ishak](/wiki/Yusof_Ishak) and [Benjamin Sheares](/wiki/Benjamin_Sheares), have died in office; one president, [Devan Nair](/wiki/Devan_Nair), has resigned mid-term; and the longest serving president is [S. R. Nathan](/wiki/S._R._Nathan), at 12 years over two terms. ## List of presidents This article is part of a series on[Politics of Singapore](/wiki/Politics_of_Singapore)[Constitution](/wiki/Constitution_of_Singapore) - [Law](/wiki/Law_of_Singapore) - [Human rights](/wiki/Human_rights_in_Singapore) [Legislature](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore) - **[Parliament](/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore)** - [Speaker](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Parliament_of_Singapore) [Seah Kian Peng](/wiki/Seah_Kian_Peng) ([PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)) - [Leader of the House](/wiki/Leader_of_the_House_(Singapore)) [Indranee Rajah](/wiki/Indranee_Rajah) ([PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)) - [Leader of the Opposition](/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Singapore)) [Pritam Singh](/wiki/Pritam_Singh_(Singaporean_politician)) ([WP](/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Singapore))) - [14th Parliament](/wiki/14th_Parliament_of_Singapore) - [Constituencies](/wiki/Constituencies_of_Singapore) [Executive](/wiki/Government_of_Singapore#Composition) - **[President of Singapore](/wiki/President_of_Singapore)** (list) - [Tharman Shanmugaratnam](/wiki/Tharman_Shanmugaratnam) ([I](/wiki/Independent_politician)) - **[Prime Minister of Singapore](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore)** - [Lawrence Wong](/wiki/Lawrence_Wong) ([PAP](/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)) - [Cabinet](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Singapore) - [Ministries](/wiki/Organisation_of_the_Government_of_Singapore) - [The Reserves](/wiki/Reserves_of_the_Government_of_Singapore) [Judiciary](/wiki/Judicial_system_of_Singapore) - **[Supreme Court of Singapore](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Singapore)** - [Chief Justice](/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_Singapore) [Sundaresh Menon](/wiki/Sundaresh_Menon) - **[Court of Appeal](/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_of_Singapore)** - [Prakash](/wiki/Judith_Prakash) - [Tay](/wiki/Tay_Yong_Kwang) - [Chong](/wiki/Steven_Chong) - [Ang](/wiki/Belinda_Ang) - **[High Court](/wiki/High_Court_of_Singapore)** - [State Courts](/wiki/State_Courts_of_Singapore) [Elections](/wiki/Elections_in_Singapore) - [Presidential elections](/wiki/Presidential_elections_in_Singapore) - [General elections](/wiki/General_elections_in_Singapore) Singapore portal - [Other countries](/wiki/Outline_of_political_science#Politics_by_region) - v - t - e No.PortraitName (Birth–Death)Term of office[Election](/wiki/Presidential_elections_in_Singapore)[a]Ref.Took officeLeft officeTime in office1**[Yusof Ishak](/wiki/Yusof_Ishak)** (1910–1970)9 August 196523 November 1970[b]5 years, 106 days[c][d](/wiki/1967_Singaporean_presidential_election) –[Speaker of Parliament](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Parliament_of_Singapore) **[Yeoh Ghim Seng](/wiki/Yeoh_Ghim_Seng)** (1918–1993) *Acting*23 November 19702 January 197140 days –2**[Benjamin Sheares](/wiki/Benjamin_Sheares)** (1907–1981)2 January 197112 May 1981[b]10 years, 130 days(/wiki/1970_Singaporean_presidential_election)(/wiki/1974_Singaporean_presidential_election)(/wiki/1978_Singaporean_presidential_election) –[Chief Justice](/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_Singapore) **[Wee Chong Jin](/wiki/Wee_Chong_Jin)** (1917–2005) *Acting*12 May 198114 May 19812 days – –[Speaker of Parliament](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Parliament_of_Singapore) **[Yeoh Ghim Seng](/wiki/Yeoh_Ghim_Seng)** (1918–1993) *Acting*14 May 198123 October 1981162 days –3**[Devan Nair](/wiki/Devan_Nair)** (1923–2005)23 October 198128 March 1985[e]3 years, 156 days(/wiki/1981_Singaporean_presidential_election) –[Chief Justice](/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_Singapore) **[Wee Chong Jin](/wiki/Wee_Chong_Jin)** (1917–2005) *Acting*28 March 198531 March 19853 days – –[Speaker of Parliament](/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Parliament_of_Singapore) **[Yeoh Ghim Seng](/wiki/Yeoh_Ghim_Seng)** (1918–1993) *Acting*31 March 19852 September 1985155 days –4**[Wee Kim Wee](/wiki/Wee_Kim_Wee)** (1915–2005)2 September 19851 September 19937 years, 364 days(/wiki/1985_Singaporean_presidential_election)(/wiki/1989_Singaporean_presidential_election) –[Minister for the Environment](/wiki/List_of_Ministers_for_the_Environment_and_Water_Resources_(Singapore)#Ministers) **[Lim Kim San](/wiki/Lim_Kim_San)** (1916–2006) *Acting*6 March 19899 March 19893 days –5**[Ong Teng Cheong](/wiki/Ong_Teng_Cheong)** (1936–2002)1 September 19931 September 19996 years(/wiki/1993_Singaporean_presidential_election)6**[S.
