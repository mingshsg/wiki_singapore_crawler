  "content": "Housing scheme in Singapore **Design, Build and Sell Scheme** ([abbreviation](/wiki/Abbreviation): **DBSS**) was introduced by the [Housing and Development Board](/wiki/Housing_and_Development_Board) in 2005. Flats built under the scheme were meant for public housing and developed by private developers. They were built with supposedly better designs and mostly in matured estates such as [Tampines](/wiki/Tampines), [Ang Mo Kio](/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio) and [Bishan](/wiki/Bishan,_Singapore). There were 13 DBSS projects, totaling 8,533 units. The scheme attracted public outrage when a series of five-room DBSS flats developed in Tampines by Sim Lian Group Limited opened for sale at S$880,000, way higher than what could be afforded by most middle-class families. As HDB did not control the pricing of DBSS units being sold, the scheme was poorly received and subsequently suspended indefinitely. ## List of DBSS projects LocationDBSS AliasBlk / Unit noLaunched CompletionRoom Layout Design TypesUnits sqm Price Range (SGD)Land Sale / DBSS Awarded (SGD)DBSS Awarded**[Tampines](/wiki/Tampines)****The Premiere** Pilot DBSSEight 17-storey blocks 2–80 @ even numberOct 2006 Jan 20092-room 2-types 4-room 2-types 5-room 10-types4 (50 m²) $138,000 – $160,000 36 (92–95 m²) $278,000 – $410,000 576 (105–114 m²) $308,000 – $450,00018 January 2006 21,000 sq m @ $82.2 millionSim Lian Land Pte Ltd**[Boon Keng](/wiki/Boon_Keng)****City View** Press Release Three 40-storey blocks Blk 7 Unit no 130 – 140 @ even no Blk 8 Unit no 142 – 152 @ even no Blk 9 Unit no 154 – 164 @ even noJan 2008 Apr 20113-room 2-types 4-room 2-types 5-room 6-types72 (68 – 70 m²) $349,000 – $394,000 168 (94–95 m²) $523,000 – $597,000 474 (107–119 m²) $536,000 – $727,0006 June 2007 18,394 sq m @ $170.2 millionHoi Hup Realty Pte Ltd Sunway Concrete Products (S) Pte Ltd Oriental Worldwide Investments Inc **[Ang Mo Kio](/wiki/Ang_Mo_Kio)****Park Central** Press ReleaseFour 30-storey blocks Blk A, B, C, DJuly 2008 Oct 20114-room 3-types 5-room 6-types172 (90–93 m²) $433,000 – $567,000 406 (112–120 m²) $534,000 – $689,0005 December 2007 16,789.1 sq m @ $134.2 millionGreatearth Developments Pte Ltd**[Bishan](/wiki/Bishan,_Singapore)****Natura Loft** Press ReleaseThree 40-storey blocks Blk 273A, 273B, 275ANov 2008 Feb 20124-room 2-types 5-room 4-types160 (95 m²) $465,000 – $586,000 400 (120 m²) $600,000 – $739,00028 February 2008 15,218.5 sq m @ $135.9 millionQingjian Realty Pte Ltd**[Simei](/wiki/Simei)****Parc Lumiere** Press ReleaseEight 12-storey blocksApr 2009 Jul 20114-room 4-types 5-room 8-types120 (94 m²) $378,000 – $425,000 240 (107–111 m²) $462,000 – $575,0006 June 2008 16,825.5 sq m @ $52 millionSim Lian Land Pte Ltd**[Toa Payoh](/wiki/Toa_Payoh)****The Peak** Press ReleaseTwo 42-storey blocks Blk 138A, 139B Three 40-storey blocks Blk 138B, 138C, 139AApr 2009 Jul 20123-room 2-types 4-room 1-type 5-room 5-types42 (70 m²) $355,000 – $398,000 306 (91 m²) $468,000 – $582,000 830 (110–117 m²) $539,000 – $722,00022 August 2008 27,479.90 sq m @ $198.8 millionHoi Hup Realty Pte Ltd Sunway Developments Pte Ltd Hoi Hup JV Development Pte Ltd **[Yishun](/wiki/Yishun)****Adora Green** Press Release Archived 2012-03-30 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine)Six 16-storey blocks 347A - B, 348A - DFeb 20113-room 2-types 4-room 2-types 5-room 2-types67 m² ~ $300,000 – $400,000 92 m² ~ $400,000 – $500,000 112 m² ~ $500,000 – $600,00024 May 2010 27,473.70 sq m @ $148.9 millionGuthrie (DBP) Pte Ltd SK Land Pte Ltd **Tampines****Centrale 8** Press Release Archived 2012-03-30 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine)One 15-storey block Blk 519A Six 16-storey blocks Blk 519B - D, 520A - CJun 20113-room 4-types 4-room 3-types 5-room 3-types182 (61 – 62 m²) $389,000 – $445,000 348 (83 – 84 m²) $511,000 – $592,000 178 (108 – 109 m²) $685,000 - $778,0006 August 2010 21,131.70 sq m @ $178.1 millionSim Lian Land Pte Ltd**[Bedok](/wiki/Bedok)****Bedok Belvia** Press Release Three 14-storey blocks Three 15-storey blocksOct 2011 20143-room 2-types 4-room 3-types 5-room 3-types102 (66 – 67 m²) $387,000 – $415,000 207 (85–87 m²) $494,000 – $576,000 177 (105–109 m²) $648,000 – $727,0004 Nov 2010 16,668 sq m @ $112.7 millionCEL DevelopmentUpper Serangoon **([Hougang](/wiki/Hougang))****Parkland Residences** Press Release Archived 2010-10-19 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine) Four 18-storey blocks 475A - DJan 20123-room 2-types 4-room 2-types 5-room 3-types136 (67 m²) 272 (92 m²) 272 (109–112 m²)2 Dec 2010 20,000 sq m @ $$155.2 millionKwan Hwee Investment Pte LtdYuan Ching Road **([Jurong West](/wiki/Jurong_West))****Lake Vista** Press Release Archived 2012-04-26 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine) Four 22-storey blocks 138A - DOct 2011 20153-room 1-type 4-room 3-types 5-room 4-types67 m² $360,500 – $399,500 86–91 m² $481,000 – $575,300 105–108 m² $584,300 – $680,40010 Jan 2011 21,199.7 sq m @ $131.6 millionHoi Hup Realty Pte Ltd Sunway Developments Pte Ltd SC Wong Holdings Pte Ltd **[Clementi](/wiki/Clementi,_Singapore)****Trivelis** Press Release Archived 2012-03-31 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine) Three 40-storey blocksOct 2011 20153-room 4-types 4-room 8-types 5-room 3-types60m² $375,000 – $470,000 80–82 m² $530,000 – $650,000 105m² $658,000 – $770,00010 Mar 2011 21,906.5 sq m @ $224 millionEL Development Pte Ltd - Procedures – Buying a flat under Design, Build & Sell Scheme\n",
