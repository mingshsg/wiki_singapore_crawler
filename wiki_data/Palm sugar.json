  "content": "Sugar extracted from the sap of palm trees **Palm sugar** is a [sweetener](/wiki/Sweetener) derived from any variety of [palm tree](/wiki/Palm_tree). Palm sugar may be qualified by the type of palm, as in [coconut palm sugar](/wiki/Coconut_palm_sugar). While sugars from different palms may have slightly different compositions, all are processed similarly and can be used interchangeably. ## Types This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *Find sources:* \"Palm sugar\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(August 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)* The predominant sources of palm sugar are the [Palmyra](/wiki/Borassus), [date](/wiki/Date_palm), [nipa](/wiki/Nypa_fruticans), [aren](/wiki/Arenga_pinnata), and [coconut](/wiki/Coconut) palms. The Palmyra palm (*Borassus* spp.) is grown in Africa, Asia, and [New Guinea](/wiki/New_Guinea). The tree has many uses, such as thatching, hatmaking, timber, a [writing material](/wiki/Writing_material), and in food products. Palm sugar is produced from [sap](/wiki/Sap) (toddy) from the flowers. There are two species of date palm that produce palm sugar: *[Phoenix dactylifera](/wiki/Phoenix_dactylifera)* and *[P. sylvestris](/wiki/Phoenix_sylvestris)*. *P. dactylifera* is common in the [Mediterranean](/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea) and Middle East, while *P. sylvestris* is native to Asia, mainly Pakistan and India. Date palms are cultivated mainly for dates and palm sugar is made from the tree's sap. The nipa palm (*[Nypa fruticans](/wiki/Nypa_fruticans)*) is native to the coastlines and tropical regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is the only palm tree that grows in a watery [mangrove](/wiki/Mangrove) biome. Only its leaves and flowers are able to grow above water. Palm sugar is made from the sugar-rich sap. The sugar palm (*[Arenga pinnata](/wiki/Arenga_pinnata)*) is native to the [coastal](/wiki/Coast) and [tropical regions of Asia](/wiki/Climate_of_Asia), mainly China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The sap used to produce palm sugar is known in India as *gur* and in Indonesia as *gula aren*. The coconut palm' (*Cocos nucifera*) yields [coconut palm sugar](/wiki/Coconut_sugar) from the sap of its flowers. It grows in coastal areas of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Major suppliers are Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. ## Production Palm sugar is produced by boiling collected sap until it thickens. The boiled sap can be sold as [palm syrup](/wiki/Palm_syrup). It is sold in bottles or tins and tends to thicken and crystallise over time. The boiled sap can also be solidified and sold as bricks or cakes. It can range in colour from golden brown to dark brown or almost black, like Indonesian *gula aren*. ## Use Palm sugar is an ingredient in both sweet and savoury dishes used throughout Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. ## Local variants Palm sugar is known by many names and variants depending on its ingredient, production method, or region. It is known as *gula jawa* ([Javanese](/wiki/Java) sugar) in [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine), and *gula melaka* ([Malaccan](/wiki/Malacca) sugar) in Malaysia. A specific difference in palm sugar naming is seen in Indonesia; if it is made from [coconut](/wiki/Coconut_sugar), it is called as *gula jawa* or *gula merah* (red sugar), on the other hand *gula aren* (aren sugar) refer to palm sugar that specifically made from the sap of [aren palm](/wiki/Arenga_pinnata) flower buds. *Gula jawa* has an earthy aroma and deep sweetness with a darker colour closely resembling molasses, while *gula aren* has paler colour. *Gula melaka* is a type of palm sugar made from the sap of flower buds from the coconut palm, or less commonly, other palms. It can be dense and sticky. It is known in English as \"Malacca sugar\", probably because it originated in the state of [Malacca](/wiki/Malacca), Malaysia ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language): *Melaka*). Traditionally, *gula melaka* is made by extracting the sap from the flower bud of a coconut tree. Several slits are cut into the bud, and a pot is tied underneath to collect the sap. The sap is then boiled until it thickens. Next, the sap is poured into bamboo tubes 8–10 centimetres (3–5 in) long and left to solidify to form cylindrical cake blocks. Due to the labour involved in the production, it is often more expensive than the ubiquitous [cane sugar](/wiki/Cane_sugar). It is used in some savoury dishes, but mainly in the local desserts and cakes of the Southeast Asian region.[*citation needed*] *Gula melaka sago* [pudding](/wiki/Pudding) is a dessert made with *gula melaka* and a common hot or cold dish of Indo-Malay origin. Other examples include *[chendol](/wiki/Chendol)* and *ondeh ondeh*, a ball-shaped dessert made from glutinous rice flour, filled with *gula melaka*, and covered in shredded coconut.[*citation needed*] - [Coconut sugar](/wiki/Coconut_sugar) – Sugar produced from the coconut palm - [Date sugar](/wiki/Date_sugar) – Sugar extracted from dates - [Jaggery](/wiki/Jaggery) – Unrefined cane sugar\n",
