  "content": "Top-ranking police officer of the Singapore Police Force The **Commissioner of Police** is the head of the [Singapore Police Force](/wiki/Singapore_Police_Force) (SPF). The Commissioner is assisted by the [Deputy Commissioner of Police](/wiki/Deputy_Commissioner_of_Police_(Singapore)), and reports to the [Minister for Home Affairs](/wiki/Minister_for_Home_Affairs_(Singapore)). The current Commissioner of Police is How Kwang Hwee. The position was created with the [Police Act](/wiki/Police_Act) of 1856 (and passed in 1857), in response to calls for a full-time dedicated police officer to helm the police force in response to escalating cases of violent crime in Singapore during that period. [Thomas Dunman](/wiki/Thomas_Dunman) was appointed as a Deputy Magistrate and Superintendent of Police in 1843, before he assumed responsibilities as the first full-time Commissioner of Police in June 1857. When [Singapore](/wiki/Colony_of_Singapore), [Malacca](/wiki/Crown_Colony_of_Malacca) and [Penang](/wiki/Crown_Colony_of_Penang) became [Crown colonies](/wiki/Crown_colonies) of the [British Empire](/wiki/British_Empire) in 1867, the role of the police commissioner was expanded to include that of the entire [Straits Settlements](/wiki/Straits_Settlements), with the title changed to [Inspector-General of Police](/wiki/Inspector-General_of_Police). This lasted until the [Japanese occupation of Singapore](/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore) in 1942, before the position was restored as the **Commissioner of Police** in 1946 with the return of the British and the gradual instatement of self-governance. The [President of Singapore](/wiki/President_of_Singapore) has the power to appoint the Commissioner of Police on the advice of the Cabinet. ## List of commissioners of police ### Commissioner of the Singapore Police Force #PortraitCommissioner of PoliceTook officeLeft office1R E Foulger194619512J P Pennefather-Evans195119523Nigel G Morris195219574Alan Edmund Grove Blades195719645[John Le Cain](/wiki/John_Le_Cain)196419676Cheam Kim Seang196719727Tan Teck Khim197319818Goh Yong Hong198119929[Tee Tua Ba](/wiki/Tee_Tua_Ba)1992199710[Khoo Boon Hui](/wiki/Khoo_Boon_Hui)1997201011Ng Joo Hee2010201512Hoong Wee Teck2015202613How Kwang Hwee2026*Incumbent* ## List of inspectors-general of police ### Commissioner of the Straits Settlements Police #PortraitCommissioner of PoliceTook officeLeft office1[Thomas Dunman](/wiki/Thomas_Dunman)18571871 ### Inspector-General of the Straits Settlements Police #PortraitInspector-General of PoliceTook officeLeft office1C B Plunket187118752[Samuel Dunlop](/wiki/Samuel_Dunlop)187518913R W Maxwell189118954E G Pennefather189519065[William Andrew Cuscaden](/wiki/William_Andrew_Cuscaden)190619146A R Chancellor191419237G C Denham192319258[Harold Fairburn](/wiki/Harold_Fairburn)192519359[René H de S Onraet](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Onraet)1935193910[Arthur Harold Dickinson](/wiki/Arthur_Harold_Dickinson)19391942 - \"Policing Singapore in the 19th & 20th centuries\", Peer M.
