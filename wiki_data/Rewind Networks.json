  "content": "Singaporean media company **Rewind Networks Private Limited** is a [Singaporean](/wiki/Singapore) media company. The company owns three linear television channels (HITS, HITS Movies, HITS Now). ## History Rewind Networks was established in 2013 with the launch of its first channel, HITS, on 9 December, beginning on [StarHub TV](/wiki/StarHub_TV) in Singapore. Its launch was made to counter the rise in piracy in the region. An on-demand service, HITS Now, was announced for a 2014 launch. The company announced its second channel, HITS Movies, in March 2018. It focused on feature films. Its launch slate consisted of movies from the 1960s to the 1990s. The channel launched on 1 October 2018, initially only on StarHub. HITS and HITS Movies were added to [Hong Kong Cable TV](/wiki/Hong_Kong_Cable_Television) in the wake of the shutdown of most Disney-owned channels on 1 October 2021. On 16 November, the main HITS channel was added to [LG U+](/wiki/LG_U%2B). On 6 February 2023, HITS Now launched as an SVOD platform, on Singtel in Singapore and First Media and Indihome in Indonesia. The new channel carries award shows, reality/talent competitions and recent US series.\n",
