  "content": "* **Pasar pagi*** ([Malay](/wiki/Malay_language)/[Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesian_language), lit.: 'morning market') is a type of traditional [market](/wiki/Market_(place)) found in [Malaysia](/wiki/Malaysia) and [Indonesia](/wiki/Indonesia), sometimes classified as a [wet market](/wiki/Wet_market). ## Operating hours *Pasar pagi* mostly operates from early morning to the afternoon. Nevertheless, there is also a related traditional market called *[pasar malam](/wiki/Pasar_malam)* (lit. 'night market'). The difference between *pasar pagi* and *pasar malam* is in its operating hours. *Pasar pagi* opens early in the morning from dawn to noon every day, approximately from 04:00 to 12:00. On the other hand, *pasar malam* opens at night, approximately from 17:00 to 22:00, and only on selected days of the week. The type of goods being sold is also quite different. *Pasar pagi* is where many housewives, domestic helpers, and local folks appear to shop for their daily needs, mostly uncooked fresh [produce](/wiki/Greengrocer). The things that are on sale are usually fresh daily produce, including [fruits](/wiki/Fruits), [vegetables](/wiki/Vegetables), [spices](/wiki/Spices), [fish](/wiki/Fish_as_food), [meat](/wiki/Meat), [eggs](/wiki/Egg_as_food), and all kinds of daily products. While *pasar malam* is more to cater a leisurely shopping and eating-out activity, selling ready-to-eat food, snacks, clothing, and various knick-knacks. ## Indonesia In Indonesia, practically all traditional markets are *pasar pagi*, open from early in the [dawn](/wiki/Dawn) to mid-day. Often the stalls are temporarily overflowing occupying nearby streets around the marketplace — which normally open for traffic in other hours of the day. They sell fresh produce, such as vegetables, fruits, chicken, meat, and fish. The major *pasar pagi* in [Jakarta](/wiki/Jakarta) are Pasar Pagi Mangga Dua, Pasar Induk Kramat Jati, [Pasar Minggu](/wiki/Pasar_Minggu) and [Pasar Senen](/wiki/Senen). Pasar Minggu specializes in fruits and vegetables, while Pasar Senen specializes on selling *[kue](/wiki/Kue)*, as they offer a rich variety of traditional Indonesian snacks, open every *subuh* (dawn). Meanwhile, in [Samarinda](/wiki/Samarinda), the only market named as such is the [Samarinda Morning Market](/wiki/Samarinda_Morning_Market). ## Malaysia In Malaysia, one of the biggest *pasar pagi* is at Pasar Pudu at [Pudu](/wiki/Pudu,_Kuala_Lumpur) and Jalan Pasar at [Chow Kit](/wiki/Chow_Kit) area in [Kuala Lumpur](/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur). In March 2020, all wet markets (including pasar pagi) were temporarily banned from operating due to the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). - [Bazaar](/wiki/Bazaar) - [Hawker centre](/wiki/Hawker_centre), open-air complexes in Malaysia and Singapore housing many stalls that sell a variety of inexpensive food - *[Kopi tiam](/wiki/Kopi_tiam)* ('coffee shop') - [Market (place)](/wiki/Market_(place)) - *[Pasar malam](/wiki/Pasar_malam)* ('night market') - [Retail](/wiki/Retail) - [Wet market](/wiki/Wet_market)\n",
